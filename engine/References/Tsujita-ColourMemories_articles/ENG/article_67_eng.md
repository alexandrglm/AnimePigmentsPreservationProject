## Episode 67: Once Upon a Time... (44) - There Were Actually Two Types! The Secret of Super Saiyans

The morning and evening air is completely autumn now. Days are increasing where it's cold enough to catch a cold if you're not careful. During these past few days when I've been coming home in the early morning due to work, the morning sky has been wonderful every day. The clouds are just great.

Every day, every morning, the sky's expression is completely different. The way light overflows, the colors of clouds. And they're wonderfully beautiful - I can't help but pray to the rising morning sun. Somehow, it feels so blessed (laugh).

This season when it gradually gets colder might be when morning feels most pleasant. Ah, I want to travel with my camera to capture wonderful mornings. Of course, hot springs would be a set deal.

Well then.

"The Namekians who migrated to New Namek were being attacked by someone and facing extinction. Dende, who became Earth's new 'God,' sensed this. He asked Goku and others to save New Namek. Goku, Gohan, Piccolo and the group headed to New Namek. What awaited the arriving group was a mysterious robot army and Cooler, who had been revived with a mechanical body - Metal Cooler..."

I rewatched theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors* for probably the first time since the first print. This was because theatrical *Dragon Ball* DVDs were being released, and the one I ordered happened to arrive recently.

Man, hahaha (bitter laugh).

As always, reviewing old work I did is quite embarrassing or rather ticklish. I can't help but go "Ah~" (bitter laugh). I really remember things in detail. Watching the footage brings back even more detailed memories.

Reviewing it confirmed that there were more Taiyo Shikisai paint scenes and cuts than I thought - I was surprised. More than that - over half were Taiyo Shikisai color cuts. That means we asked Korean productions to handle that much work.

Speaking of Dragon Ball and Goku, it's Super Saiyans. When they raise their "ki" and go "uryaa!" their hair stands up and turns golden, becomes high-contrast coloring, and they rampage stronger while wrapped in brush auras - that thing.

This Super Saiyan processing had two strength variations, but did you all know about this?

When Goku transforms from normal state to Super Saiyan, first he becomes the "strong" type processing with a "dowaa!" (the production name was probably 'B' type? "weak" was 'A'), and when conversations continued long in that state, he'd be dropped to "weak," then when battle resumed he'd go "doryaa!" back to "strong" type - that kind of usage.

Theatrical versions tended to jump straight into "uryaa!" battles, so we didn't use the "weak" type much, but TV series, which inevitably had long conversational scenes due to story development, used this "weak" type processing quite often.

How were they different? The "weak" compared to "strong" had: 1. Hair color was lighter (whitish) yellow, 2. Body high-contrast coloring was more restrained, 3. Special effects (brush & touch) aura worn was lighter.

Dramatically, standing around talking while constantly in a heightened state would be awkward, so naturally such strength variations were essential, but apparently there was also some desire to reduce work load.

This Saiyan aura special effects work was incredibly difficult. Since it was cel animation then, all these auras were hand-drawn by special effects staff. First they'd cut out masking cels for brushing according to animation drawings. Using those masks they'd spray brush, then hand-draw dynamic touches around those brush areas. Special effects staff worked on this frame by frame, cut by cut.

*Dragon Ball* also had many character-specific special effects rules. Being a long-running series, the sheer volume was tremendous. Hirao-san, who was special effects team chief at the time, kept detailed notes on everything, and the entire effects team used it as a "*Dragon Ball* special effects encyclopedia" whenever needed.

Incidentally, during production of the recent new work for Shueisha JUMP Tours, that legacy was apparently utilized. Even with today's digital coloring, Saiyan auras were apparently still hand-drawn brush & touch (bitter laugh).

This "weak" type was used quite a bit in *Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors*. That was processing matched to TV series precedent. For customers who watch TV and come to theaters, showing them the same thing as TV would be somehow insufficient and regrettable. So we wanted to show speedier, more voluminous, thoroughly satisfying footage than TV. But if it strayed too far from TV, it would become "huh?" - being careful about that balance is the key point when making theatrical versions of TV works.

Come to think of it, later theatrical versions decided "Let's stop using 'weak'?" and I think I was the one who suggested it...

The hair color during "weak" times didn't have good saturation (color development) and didn't show up well on film, creating a kind of indigestion or frustration I remember. The "strong" hair also had poor saturation, but the "weak" with lighter aura processing looked more conspicuously dull. Hmm. In terms of color development, STAC paints were definitely superior, I deeply felt. As I wrote two episodes ago, those "slight errors" in STAC→Taiyo Shikisai conversion really bothered me on screen.

Anyway, we somehow managed to complete it and achieved nationwide March release. After somehow finishing and taking a breather, the script for summer Toei Manga Festival's *Dragon Ball Z* was at my desk.

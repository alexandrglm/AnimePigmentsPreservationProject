Episode 109: Once Upon a Time... (66) *Sailor Moon R* Movie
...Oh, and About *Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection*

Last weekend saw the nationwide release of *Strong World ONE PIECE FILM*, which turned into a situation far beyond our wildest imagination. From the first showings in the morning to the late-night screenings on opening day and the second day, theaters across the country were completely sold out. Seeing footage of the long lines of customers surrounding theaters who came to watch—wow, what a surprise. I knew advance ticket sales were incredible, so I personally expected "there'll probably be some lines," but I honestly hadn't imagined it would reach this scale.

From what I hear, the box office revenue for the three days from opening exceeded 1.3 billion yen. Hmm... such an incredible amount that I don't know how to react (sweat).

By the way, this day was also the opening day for *Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection*.

I was once a middle schooler who camped out overnight in front of a Shinjuku theater for the opening day of *Farewell Space Battleship Yamato—Warriors of Love*. And today, a project I was involved with has long lines at theaters. Moreover, this huge success competing with *Yamato* on its opening day. There's something I can't quite put into words about how that feels.

Well, we on the *Strong World* staff are fully aware that so many people flocked to see it because of the comic "Volume 0" admission gift. Even so, having this many people watch the work we worked so hard to create is truly a happy thing. Thank you so much, everyone!

The release is just getting started. For those who haven't seen it yet, and for those who'll come to see it a second and third time, please take your time and enjoy the main feature.

Now then, yesterday during a work break I slipped out and went to see *Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection*.

You see, for me, my anime roots are *Space Battleship Yamato* (宇宙戦艦ヤマト), which I was obsessed with in elementary school. So I was extremely curious about this *Resurrection*. Plus it opened on the same day as the theatrical *ONE PIECE* I was involved with! So I wanted to see it as soon as possible.

Wow, it was fantastic! Honestly, it gave me goosebumps!

*Resurrection* was completely and utterly *Yamato* itself! This is incredibly amazing.

There are many anime in the world where sequels are made after a long time has passed since the previous work. It's common to bring contemporary "modern" elements and tastes into sequels. Some works succeed by skillfully digesting and fusing these elements, but more often than not, things tend to go wrong, and they get criticized as failures or questionable. That's not uncommon.

But this *Resurrection* stayed completely true without wavering—it was *Yamato* itself through and through! The Yamato ship itself and all the mechs and battles became CG, the characters aged, and quite a few "new faces" were added, but the world and goals there were completely and utterly *Yamato* itself! This is amazing. It showed us "the Yamato we know" itself.

Throughout the entire film, the mechanics and battle scenes centered around the CG-rendered Yamato—I was a bit wary of potential awkwardness before watching, but once the story began, I felt a reassuring familiarity as if I'd known it forever, a natural, settled texture on screen.

What I personally call "Yamato methodology"—how characters are presented, how battle screens and cuts are built up, getting the exact shot you want at the moment you want it, music sliding in at just the right time. Ah, this sensation is Yamato, I thought. They properly followed that flow in creating this. Watching this made me truly happy.

In *Resurrection*, what's truly eye-catching is the visual upgrade and its overwhelming power. The beautifully reborn CG Yamato. It probably shows us the form we'd been expanding in our heads all those years ago when we took the hand-drawn Yamato and imagined it freely, making me think "Yes, yes, this is it!" rather than feeling any awkwardness. It's that kind of upgrade.

The texture in close-up shots is impressive, but the presence in wide shots is incredible. While the hand-drawn original works had some disappointing animation in wide shots, this CG version doesn't suffer from character model collapse.

And the characters! Kodai has aged and become more dashing, and most of the characters are new. Each one has great individual flavor. Those characters were all Kogawa-san! throughout. They were charming characters that felt nostalgic while being properly new.

The art was amazing too! And the color work was wonderful!

When mechanics and art become more realistic and the acting gets deeper, the character colors naturally tend to get pulled along and become overly realistic. You see this in various anime where they do scene-by-scene color changes too deeply and end up leaving the viewers behind.

But in this *Resurrection*, the balance—that sense of proportion to avoid "going too far"—was excellent. The scene-by-scene crafting, the psychological expression through cut-by-cut color building, including the photography processing, all had this exquisite "properly done but not overdone" feeling. They pushed forward and expanded new visuals from the previous *Yamato* works here too, which was admirable. As a fellow professional, I was actually envious.

Also, the story beginning and progressing without explaining anything from before felt refreshing (laugh). People who've followed *Yamato* will appreciate this approach. After all, there's the feeling that "we don't need every little thing we already know explained to us."

So it's honestly unfriendly to people encountering *Yamato* for the first time through this movie (wry laugh), but I'd rather tell such people: "Please rent and watch the theatrical *Yamato* and *Final Yamato* on DVD first!"

That's how I'd like people to enjoy and get hooked on *Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection*. I want people to see *ONE PIECE*, but I want everyone to see this too!

Now then.

...Oh.

I wrote too much "introduction" (sweat). You've all noticed, right? (laugh) ...Which means, *Sailor Moon R* movie continues next time...

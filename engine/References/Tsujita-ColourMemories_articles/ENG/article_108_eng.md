Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 108: Once Upon a Time... (65) I Love Thinking About Girls' Clothing Colors! *Sailor Moon R* Movie

Monday through Tuesday this week, I went to Kyoto again (which is why I missed my Tuesday deadline (sweat)). Self-funded location scouting to mentally prepare for a certain new project. Well, the previous trip was similar (laugh). This time the director also asked me to shoot video materials for the main production, so I went and struggled with an unfamiliar movie camera.

Since this was an overnight trip, I was able to enjoy various delicious Kyoto foods. My goodness, Kyoto is delicious (laugh).

As I mentioned before, even though I went to Kyoto twice on school trips, when I think about it, I didn't really eat anything decent. Basically we'd return to the inn for meals and the whole grade would eat the inn's food all together. I'm sure Kyoto specialties were on the table too, but we were a group of kids starving for meat, so rather than savoring anything, it was all about quantity first!

Two nights with two dinners, one of which was sukiyaki. Back then, I think all I could think about was meat. On the high school trip, we'd collect meat that the girls didn't eat because they said "it'll make me fat" and eat it in our own hot pot. Some groups even stopped by butcher shops during free time and bought extra beef on their own (laugh).

Now, over thirty years later, I've finally reached an age where I can enjoy Kyoto cuisine in a proper adult manner.

And that "new project" has finally had its information released. *The Tatami Galaxy* (四畳半神話大系), please look forward to it!

And the "pirate movie," *Strong World ONE PIECE FILM*, finally opens nationwide tomorrow! Everyone, thank you for waiting! ...Though I hear it's become quite a situation with the first and second days completely sold out for all showings (sweat). Everyone, do your best to go see it!

Now then.

Continuing the story of *Sailor Moon R* movie.

Around the time the key animation was making its way to me, we finalized the color schemes for the character cast. As with usual projects, I created color sample cels for the characters I was assigned, and all the main staff checked them together, exchanging opinions to make the final decisions.

This time, we had Director Ikuhara, Assistant Director Igarashi, Art Director Taniguchi Junichi, and myself—a group of relatively similar ages. Oh, Producer Azuma was also the same age as me. This group gathered to check the color samples. I believe Key Animation Director Tadano wasn't present at this time? I remember that we made certain decisions among ourselves and then showed them to him later for approval... but wait? Was that different? (←My memory is quite vague here (sweat))

Though I'd just finished *Coo: Far From Home*, a major theatrical work, it had been quite a while since I'd done a movie adaptation of a TV series, especially a hit one. Not since *Saint Seiya: Legend of Crimson Youth* (聖闘士星矢　真紅の少年伝説), I think? So I was putting in extra effort (laugh).

Since it was based on a hit TV series, naturally the audience coming to see it would be people who watched the TV show. Plus since this was the first movie adaptation, there were "first movie constraints," so we basically didn't make major color changes from the TV version. Oh, I've written about this before.

At the time, quite a lot of high-contrast works were popular and trending. In fact, stronger shadows do make the screen more impressive when projected in theaters. But honestly, I wasn't really fond of things getting too harsh.

Sure, battle scenes should be sharp and cool, and scenes with clear light sources or scenes where you want to leave a strong, impressive image should use fairly strong contrast to build the screen, but for other scenes, I thought a softer feel would be better. I believe I discussed this various ways with the director and convinced (?) him (laugh).

So I tweaked the shadow colors of the main costumes (Sailor Warriors) just a little, just a tiny bit. In exchange, I kept the casual clothes scenes—the normal, gentle scenes—at basically the same balance as the TV version.

And these casual clothes—thinking about their colors is so much fun! After all, in *Saint Seiya* I created various Saint colors, but the only girl was Saori-san in her same outfit all the time, and the theatrical work I'd been doing right before this had characters running on the beach in shorts and T-shirts (laugh). Working on the color coordination for fashionable, slightly realistic girls' clothing that seemed trendy at the time was such enjoyable, delightful work (laugh).

For each character's casual outfit designs, I thought about their individual personalities and created about two different combination sets—one harder, one softer—to show them. With just minor adjustments, they got approval quite smoothly.

For the enemy character Fiore, Director Ikuhara had a solid image in mind, so I remember creating the initial color scheme fairly in line with the director's vision. Wait? Was there a TV story this was based on first? Or did the TV episode come from this? (←My memory is quite vague here too (sweat))

Incidentally, the "first movie constraints" were unwritten Toei rules when adapting TV series into movies—things like using the TV series opening as-is for the first movie adaptation, among several such unwritten "rules." They don't say such things much anymore recently. Actually, since the "manga festival" format disappeared in recent years, TV series movie adaptations themselves have decreased.

But *Sailor Moon R* movie didn't use the TV opening. They used the opening theme song, but the background was footage from the theatrical version. I think Director Ikuhara wouldn't compromise on this point (←this memory is also vague).

# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 88: Once Upon a Time... (52) - Colors Created! The Secret of BG-2A, BG-3A, and CR-1A, CR-2A

From last week through this week, there was a big move in the color design room at Toei Animation's (東映アニメーション) Oizumi Studio. Since I became freelance, the room was divided into a room for freelance people and others. And with that came the big move. And personal organization, major cleanup.

What I thought was just recently turned out to be over 15 years since I moved into the current room. In that time, I accumulated so much stuff that I reset everything and disposed of a tremendous variety of things.

I kept only commemorative works' storyboards and setting materials from old works, discarding the rest. I discarded old reference magazines and books including manga that had become outdated. I discarded all MO disks (!) containing early digital work data (←the data had been converted to CDs long ago). Personal music recordings on cassette tapes and MD disks were also discarded.

I was amazed at the sheer volume of items that had been placed around this desk area (laughs).

At the same time, various things were "excavated"!

There were mountains of main production materials related to *Coo: Far From Home* that I'm writing about now. And looking at such things made me lose track of time, so cleanup wouldn't progress, wouldn't progress (laughs).

Still, I somehow forced myself to clean up and successfully created a "new nest" (laughs).

"From now on, I'm going to live as lightly as possible!" - so I vowed (laughs).

Now then.

"Then let's make them."

"Huh? Is that okay?" said I.

"You can't do it with existing paints, right? Then let's have the paint company make them. This is such a big theatrical work."

The color of the crucial protagonist Coo in the theatrical work *Coo: Far From Home* absolutely wouldn't be decided. With the paints available at Toei Animation, the color tone was impossible. Then this surprising development occurred suddenly.

This development honestly surprised me. Actually, I had been thinking "that's the only method, isn't it?" but I thought "well, it's probably impossible."

I had tried searching for suitable paints among Taiyo Shikisai paints that Toei Animation didn't basically use, but even with Taiyo Shikisai's extensive color range, the colors usable for Coo's body were also subtle. But I was thinking that maybe in the end I'd have to have the director compromise somewhere around there.

The fundamental reason for being cautious about making new paints was that ultimately, increasing colors meant extra money.

At that time, professional cel coloring paints in large business bottles (called "kilo bottles") cost 2000 yen per bottle for STAC (incidentally, Taiyo Shikisai was about 1600 yen). These had to be stocked at studios handling coloring work. Since the character requiring these new colors was the "protagonist" Coo, naturally he appeared most frequently, so it wouldn't end with one or two bottles - large quantities had to be prepared. If this increased to 3 colors, 4 colors and beyond, costs would increase accordingly.

Coloring work was a per-piece world. Even for theatrical works, Toei work's contract rates were probably around 300 yen per piece (maybe a bit higher?). Paint costs and such were included in that amount. So when the paints used (prepared) increased, production became that much more difficult.

"Then why not supply the needed new colors in kind as needed?" - I would think, but "material costs are included in the unit price," and somehow the company side wouldn't budge on that point (laughs).

Also, at that time, the center of Toei works' coloring operations was gradually shifting to a studio in Manila, Philippines. At that time, all cels and paints for Manila studios were sent from Japan by sea mail - a time-consuming system (though industrial products that could be made locally like cut bags were made locally). So if paint ran short during production, it would be terrible, so large quantities had to be sent anticipating surpluses.

The new colors made this time would only be usable for *COO* production, and these colors wouldn't remain on Toei Animation's color chart for use in any work in the future. For such reasons, "increasing new 'colors'" was in a sense a production taboo.

But we decided to make them anyway. While the aforementioned issues certainly existed, from the position of deciding colors, this was an unprecedented great opportunity.

"List up how many you'll need."

When told that, naturally "necessary colors" transform into "desired colors" (laughs). So the colors I listed, even after cutting down, were about 10 colors. I submitted this to the company... but as generally expected, things got cloudy (laughs). Apparently there was indeed various debate among higher-ups in the production department, and the result was "10 colors is too many!" - the list was returned (laughs). But it wasn't completely rejected - with the condition "minimum," it became possible.

"Well, I suppose so," said I. I had honestly anticipated such a situation (laughs). So I resubmitted a list of 4 colors that were absolutely essential new colors, and somehow got the go-ahead.

Those 4 colors were: first, 2 colors for "Coo's" body color. Coo's body would be painted in two colors - upper and lower surfaces - the upper surface normal color and regular shadow color. I mixed existing BG-series paints to make sample amounts and painted color samples, getting the director's approval. These were given to the paint company for production. They were named BG-2A and BG-3A respectively.

And 2 more colors. These were "Cathy's" skin colors.

Cathy was a white woman tanned brown, but Toei's paints didn't have suitable paints. The limited variety of skin color variations in Toei's paints was truly fatal. So, I'll confess here for the first time, I plotted something a bit sneaky.

The newly made colors were CR-1A and CR-2A. Actually, these 2 colors were Taiyo Shikisai paint colors 56N (←probably) and 45M. I made color samples using these 2 Taiyo Shikisai paint colors I personally owned and had STAC make them.

While the new colors were supposedly "only for *COO* production," I thought:

"Since we'll probably make too many and have leftovers anyway, and if there are leftovers it's wasteful, so it's better to use them for other works too, right? (grin)"

Regardless of Coo's body colors, these brownish skin-tone intermediate colors were colors I definitely wanted to use for works other than *COO*, especially video works. Even if I couldn't use them openly, if I used them secretly to an unnoticed degree, it would be fine - I had such calculations. And if they ran short by any chance, I could just use Taiyo Shikisai paints directly.

Actually, from *COO* onward, these 2 colors continued to be used "secretly" in quite a few works I participated in (laughs).

Also, there were production systems like the theatrical *Dragon Ball Z* I had participated in before entering *COO*, where during crunch time we'd do color direction with Taiyo Shikisai colors and have Korean studios do the coloring - I thought these could be used in such cases too!

So we could use 4 new colors.

While there were only these 4 colors for heavy use as new colors, I thought that probably during color direction work, there would be colors I'd want to use like "just here! just this cut!" depending on the cut. In such cases, I could either add paint I made myself to coloring orders cut by cut, or have it ordered from coloring studios that had Taiyo Shikisai paints - I was determined to use every possible means.

Thus *Coo: Far From Home* was able to establish a system for creating "colors" using the highest number of colors in Toei Animation work history.

And finally we'd enter the real production of main episode screens.

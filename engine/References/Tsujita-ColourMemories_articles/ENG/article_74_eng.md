## Episode 74: Happy New Year! New Year's Greetings and This Year's Aspirations

Happy New Year.

Did everyone have "first dreams" (初夢)?

The dream you have from New Year's night to the morning of the 2nd is called the first dream, apparently, and wow, I had quite a vivid one.

Amazingly, I was jogging (burst of laughter).

I was running on roads near my house, and even ran on the jogging track at a nearby park (laughs). That was my first dream.

The me in the dream looked pretty serious about it too (laughs). Ah, does this mean "Go jogging!"? Recently, my weight - or rather, my waistline - has been getting concerning.

Hmm, maybe I should put some spirit into it and start running.

First, let me get some new workout wear... Oh, and new shoes too...

Right! The first step in everything is getting the right look! (←misunderstanding)

Please look forward to this year's me! (mysterious)

Now then.

New Year's ended so quickly, didn't it (laughs).

Every year, on the 1st and 2nd, we make New Year's visits to my and my wife's respective family homes. Usually by the night of the 2nd, I get drunk at my wife's family home and end up staying over. By the 3rd, I'm already working. That's how it goes every year. I'd really like to go to a hot spring for a few nights starting around the 3rd and relax (... distant gaze).

Actually, when you're working in TV, you always have weekly deliveries, so the New Year's break always creates backlogs either before New Year's or after. Speaking of which, last New Year's I was frantic with *Hakaba Kitaro* (... distant gaze).

Well, anyway, here we are in the new year.

As for this year's aspirations, well, there are various things, but first about work.

This year, I want to do lots of TV work.

Previously, from *Neighborhood Story* (ご近所物語) to *Tomorrow's Nadja* (明日のナージャ), until I was pushed out by *PreCure* (プリキュア) (burst of laughter), I participated continuously in the Sunday morning slot TV series, and during that entire period, I was in "input mode."

"Input mode." What I mean is, new things kept flowing into me, and lots of "drawers" kept accumulating inside me. When you continue making about 50 episodes a year of one work, you get to experience that many things continuously.

You see and read lots of different materials, create lots of character colors, think about lots of different scene treatments, and meet lots of different people. Each of these things remains inside you. Then when you do something next, those "drawers" become useful. And by using those "drawers," their contents become even more substantial. That's "input mode."

Conversely, big jobs like movies are "output." You use what you've stored up inside yourself in "carry-out" fashion, fighting essentially with "sliced portions."

Certainly, there is "input" while taking on and completing big jobs too, but it doesn't reach the scale you can get from TV series, and I feel the nature is different too.

So now I definitely want to do TV work - I want lots of "input" at this stage.

I want to enjoy lots of different experiences and encounters, and I want to push myself harder (laughs). I'm full of such feelings.

Well, I don't seem to be built for really large-scale work anyway (laughs).

Related to work, this year I absolutely want to master Adobe's "After Effects," the standard visual effects software!

I resolved to buy "After Effects" about 3 years ago. Spent a lot of money on it. But apparently my resolve wasn't strong enough, because I've only learned the very basics and stopped there (laughs). I want to be able to direct myself, decide colors, create screens, and even handle photography. So this year is practical study.

For private matters - or rather, hobbies - I want to take lots of photographs.

Recently, wherever I go, I always carry a good camera and take tons of shots. Yeah, I'm in love with digital cameras. If this were film cameras, the developing and printing costs would be enormous. Plus, with the attitude of "it's okay if I fail!" I can shoot aggressively, so I can try lots of different things. That's wonderful.

After all, the foundation of image-making is lenses! Cutting screens with pleasant framing, creating different screen expressions with various lenses. This is really fun (laughs).

So I want to shoot tons of daily life and go to various places to photograph everything.

Right! I want to travel! Travel, travel, trips!

Landscapes, cityscapes, little interesting objects that catch my eye, and delicious foods. I want to take tons of different photos in various places, both domestically and overseas.

Ah, speaking of overseas, I really need to do something about my English...

...When I think about it, far from leisurely hot springs, it looks like this year will be busy for me too (laughs). If I'm doing lots of TV work, I won't be able to go on trips anyway (tears).

But well, in this short life, I want to live this year to the fullest too, yes (laughs).

So please treat me well this year too! (^_^)

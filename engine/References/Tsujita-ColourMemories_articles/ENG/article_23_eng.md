## **Episode 23: Once Upon a Time... (18) *Saint Seiya* Part 5 - Things I Was Taught, Things I Learned Through Skin and Body**

I'm moving. The apartment where I've lived with my wife for 7 years has become too cramped, so we're moving to a slightly larger place.

The problem is packing. My wife is someone with few belongings so she's super relaxed, but as you can imagine, I'm... (sweat). Still, I started little by little, boxing things up.

However, those packed boxes made it impossible to move around. Two or three cardboard boxes and my room's floor is invisible! Ah, it's certainly cramped...

So before the actual move, I decided to carry as much luggage as possible to the new place myself. Well, the new place is nearby. I'm being forced into steady effort in this heat (cries).

By the way, while I'm writing these old *Saint Seiya* stories, new work information was officially announced:

***Saint Seiya: Hades Elysion Chapter***

(http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/sp/seiya/). Actually, **Araki-san** and the *Hades Chapter* staff are currently in production for this winter's broadcast start (**SKY PerfecTV!**). Of course I'm participating too.

This series will go through to the end of **Kurumada-sensei**'s original source material. After a long gap, about 20 years. Finally the *Saint Seiya* series reaches its end. Please look forward to it!

Well then.

From Episode 26 onward, comprehensive animation and finishing orders to Taiwanese companies started continuously at about 1 episode per 3-4 episodes, so I handled color direction and inspection for "Taiwan-sent episodes." The program's reputation and ratings were quite good, and broadcasting entered its second year, far from just 2 cours or half a year. The program entered the "**Twelve Temples arc**" and content was getting more and more exciting.

The fun part of TV series is that as you enter the rotation and participate in the work, you get more excited than TV viewers wondering "What will happen next?" Until then, I was only called when there were problems, but participating firmly in the work like this - though it's a bit cheesy to say (laughs) - love for that work grows steadily. You gradually become more of a fan of that work than anyone else (laughs).

Also, through consistent involvement, I was taught many different things by the directors. The *Seiya* direction team around this time centered on CD **Morishita-san**, **Katsumata-san**, **Akehi-san**, **Kikuchi-san**, **Yamauchi-san**, and **Ishizaki-san** - 6 people. Among Toei Doga's many directors, they were quite a "dense" bunch. Furthermore, young directors gradually joined them (since **Ishizaki-san** handled gross episodes for production company **Lifework**, unfortunately I couldn't participate in Ishizaki-san's directed episodes).

For example, the meaning of cut connections, the meaning of layouts and camera lenses capturing them (wide-angle or telephoto), things about key animation, timesheets, and timing, etc. I felt I acquired various things in more directorial fields beyond job categories.

Through working together, I'd ask questions at every opportunity, or learn by overhearing when someone else was asking. Anyway, through working closely with directors and many other staff on numerous works together, many things gradually became second nature.

In that process, I could think about various things myself - "I did it this way this time, but how about trying something like this next time" - actively speaking up and making suggestions in meetings, adding new processing attempts to the screen.

Even taking one special coloring for special image scenes, not just thinking about character colors but trying various things including photography processing was possible because of this "dense" direction team and this *Saint Seiya* work.

During this period, what was most educational was being scolded for my mistakes (laughs). Failures that made my face burn with shame are absolutely unforgettable, and you never make the same mistake twice. Learning through skin, learning through body, so to speak (laughs).

Not just being taught hand-by-hand, but accumulating many experiences like this is absolutely necessary when young. I think it was fortunate that for me it was *Saint Seiya*.

The popular *Saint Seiya* led to theatrical release. Production of the second theatrical work ***Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods*** was decided. Unfortunately I couldn't participate in the first theatrical version, but this time I could participate properly. And Director: **Yamauchi Shigeyasu**.

Here comes Yamauchi-san!

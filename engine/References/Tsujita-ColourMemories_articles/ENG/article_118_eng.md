Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 118: It's March Already But... New Year Special Edition - *STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* Notes (Final Part 4) "SW" Main Feature Complete Scene Color Design Notes! Part 3

It's completely spring now. Tokyo apparently had its cherry blossom bloom declaration, and the buds on the cherry tree-lined street near my home are swollen to bursting. We'll soon see this year's magnificent cherry blossom tunnel.

Speaking of cherry blossoms, it's hanami time!

Near my home there's Araiyakushi Park, and during hanami season it becomes incredibly bustling regardless of day or time. How incredible? The park and surrounding roads smell like nothing but beer (laugh). If you carelessly try to cross the park unguarded, that alone will get you drunk (laugh).

By the way, recently I told the *Tatami Galaxy* staff, "Don't you think the words 'four-and-a-half tatami' and 'hanami' have very high affinity?" The director replied, "Hanami sounds good. We absolutely must do it. Let's definitely do it."

However, *Tatami Galaxy* is also quite busy heading toward April broadcast start. So will we actually manage it? Hanami. Come on, for hanami's sake, let's work hard! (laugh)

Now then.

Final installment of "*SW* Main Feature Complete Scene Color Design Notes!" that I've been writing at length.

■Scene 68: Palace Research Lab Cultivation Facility

Usopp and Chopper carrying Nami and searching for "medicine" enter the research facility. The skylit glasshouse is an "IQ" cultivation facility. A somewhat fantastical screen bathed in moonlight.

This was actually another failure retake story because I didn't understand well (laugh).

During the "raid," everyone wore formal clothes, and Chopper also wore formal shoes then, but when Chopper becomes gigantic (that's the right term, right?), he's not wearing shoes? Rather, he can't wear them with hooves (laugh).

Since I didn't really understand during color direction, I had them paint it with shoe-wearing colors, but during rushes check everyone pointed it out. "Eh? Really? (sweat)" I said. While this scene was dark overall, in cuts where moonlight hit his feet, the mistake was clearly exposed... So retake repainting (wry laugh). Including the next scene, quite a number ended up as retakes. Ah, sorry.

...But there were also cuts wrong in animation, so it's a draw (ah).

■Scene 69: Palace Research Lab Chemical Factory

First, the research room interior in the scene's first half. Background art is fairly dark brown-black, with dim equipment lights in that space. Characters are also made dark to match backgrounds, but aiming for a feeling "somehow lit by equipment lights," I added faint green taste to normal parts.

The Daft chemicals being made here are yellow-green, so. Incidentally, the treatment medicine is pink. The "IQ" that's the source for making treatment medicine is also pink.

In my color imagery, yellow-green has a fairly poisonous image. And pink has an image of illness being cured. I don't know why, but perhaps it's the image of syrup medicine prescribed at pediatrics when I caught colds as a child?

The latter half, Zoro's appearance and confrontation with Indigo. I made this a complete color battle. Indigo with yellow-green reflection from his own techniques. Since Indigo was initially dominant, in the bridge confrontation's first half, Sanji receiving attacks also got Indigo's technique yellow-green reflection to create a "being pushed" feeling. After being enveloped in green flames and smoke, the tide turns. Now Zoro's technique gets red-type reflection. "High-contrast reflection should be the attacking side's color, the dominant side's color"—that's my personal rule. "Being dyed in opponent's colors" somehow has a "losing" feeling, right?

Incidentally, the first three cuts of this scene—chemicals and various things on tables. Special Effects team worked so hard it became quite like the secret underground room from "Nausicaa" (wry laugh).

■Scene 70: Palace Exterior Rooftop

Next, Sanji VS Captain Scarlett. This is fairly hand-to-hand combat. I avoided flashy color use, normally used night color base with some cuts slightly high-contrast. I briefly considered whether to color smoke from Sanji's leg techniques, but since the legs themselves looked like they'd glow nicely with transmitted light, I made the smoke whitish so that would be easily visible.

■Scene 71: Palace Exterior

The scene where Nami regains consciousness on Chopper's back. From around here, Nami's face "spots" start fading. Special Effects created nice transparency in Nami's eyes as she notices weather changes and looks around.

■Scenes 72-75: Merveille Everywhere

Shiki VS Luffy + Billy aerial battle. Around here, my initial plan considered changing colors by location, but since the animation and cut buildup speed felt good, I deliberately pushed through with basic night colors.

However, since Luffy stayed in Gear Second, I wish I could have created better reflection effects for Billy. Regarding that, there were actually circumstances where this series of cuts had key animation that didn't come up until the very end.

The scene where Shiki cuts the sea to drown Luffy and others. The seawater here combines animation-created material with CG overlay. I actually wasn't very confident about cel water colors, but the CG team put it together well.

■Scene 76, 78: Palace Exterior

From around here where storms approach and snowfall becomes intense, I made character colors "storm colors." Saturation is lowered and made slightly heavier than previous "night colors."

■Scene 77: Palace Interior Armory etc.

Chopper and others busily setting bombs. I used colors from the earlier research room here.

■Scene 79: Some Small Island

Luffy regaining consciousness and standing up. Also "storm colors." Initially Luffy wasn't bleeding, but Oda-san proposed "Shouldn't we add blood?" so forehead blood animation was added.

■Scene 80: Above Palace

Shiki VS Luffy. The decisive battle. Blizzard action throughout. And Gear Third.

In this *SW*, starting with Animation Director Sato, we had a stellar animation team, but among them, the key animation for this scene was particularly incredible. Wow, I got goosebumps doing color direction!

Within this scene, the Luffy vs Shiki battle portion's key animation was handled by Umakoshi. While *SW*'s overall art style was unified with thin, sharp line animation, this scene unleashed Umakoshi's thick-lined, truly robust animation at full strength. This power! The climactic battle heat became even hotter through that robust line strength.

This scene was also used in the trailer and animation was completed relatively early. So including colors, it could be carefully crafted.

From midway through the battle, I used overall lightning-type blue-white high-contrast color direction, but Luffy's giant leg just looked like a daikon radish no matter what (laugh). After the trailer, I changed colors and processing several times for reshooting, but couldn't shake that initial impression (wry laugh). But overall screen "momentum" created through cut accumulation was sufficient, so "OK!"

After Luffy's giant radish heel drop explodes, Sunny flies through gradually brightening dawn that shakes off the battle's lightning high-contrast. As expected, safely surviving Luffy appears in sun-bathed colors. Everyone on Sunny's deck also changes colors in two stages during this time—from anxious monotone tones to relieved brightness upon learning Luffy's safe.

■Scene 81: Navy Warship

Captured pirate captains and Navy cuts. I deliberately shifted this toward purple. Looking back later, maybe it could have been more restrained. But maybe the somewhat unstable feeling is good too. Islands are falling from the sky after all.

■Scenes 84-86: Sunny Epilogue

An epilogue hoping to achieve refreshing feeling. Basically "normal" color direction. Only ship interior brightness is slightly suppressed to match backgrounds. After big incidents end, this returns to daily life—hoping that atmosphere would come through. So I finished it unchanged without doing anything special.

Chopper holds the medicine box by hand, but "Hey, how is he holding this?" I asked. "Same as Doraemon, probably," said Kobiki-san (laugh).

In this scene, everyone changed costumes. Luffy and several others wear TV series main setting clothes, but balanced for theatrical use. Nami's dress shirt look was strong director intent, but this was also every male staff member's wish. Making it color trace finishing was my intent (laugh). For me, Robin was more striking than Nami! A see-through blouse. I was excited while creating colors (laugh). But disappointingly it didn't show much on screen.

■Ending

This was also created under incredibly tight time constraints. Several cuts came up as quite disappointing in-between animation, but naturally we couldn't cry about it—re-animation. We barely managed to remake them at the last minute.

Starting from illustration-like images like the opening, ending with the usual Luffy and others. In between, separate from East Blue scenes, several characters not appearing in the main story appear—I thought maybe this bridges to stories developing on TV.

...Thus *STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* was completed.

November某日, Preview 0 at Tokyo Chofu's Toei Lab Tech (←there were quite a lot of replacements and retakes after the Odaiba completion preview—that's just between us). After watching, meeting with lab technicians in the conference room to discuss "print" adjustments. Scene 43's colors felt somewhat brownish, so I requested adjustment to sharp blue tones with good clarity, and with that all my *SW* work was complete.

When finished watching, I casually asked Kobiki-san, "How was it?" She replied, "Throughout it really felt like Tsujita-san's screen." Well, it's probably quite different *ONE PIECE* from previous movies and TV, I thought, but that's that. What Director Sakai and we created as *STRONG WORLD* is like this.

Schedules and schedules and schedules (wry laugh)—it was tough in various ways, but I think I did all the work I possibly could, left good work.

About the post-release big hit, I was surprised to the point of "it didn't need to be that big a hit (sweat)." *ONE PIECE* popularity is really incredible. I was reminded anew.

While fully aware of big hit catalyst "Volume 0" effects, having so many people watch it was still the happiest thing for production staff. And hearing that many repeat viewers came to theaters three or four times made me even more grateful.

At the wrap party, Director Sakai said, "Someday I'd like to do another theatrical work with this staff!" All of us staff feel the same way.

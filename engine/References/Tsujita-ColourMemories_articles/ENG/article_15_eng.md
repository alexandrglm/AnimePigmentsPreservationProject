# **Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]**

## **Episode 15: Once Upon a Time... (10) Still More Collaborative Works, Then Suddenly**

**It's early summer.** The weather's decent and the sunshine feels pleasant and refreshing. The air is crisp, and even when you sweat a bit, it dries right up - GOOD.

**So I'm already in short-sleeve T-shirt mode this season.** When it gets even hotter, I won't have any more clothes to wear... I think this every year, but when next month brings the rainy season, it gets relatively cool. Well, before that, I need to be careful not to collapse from the humidity.

**I want to play outside lots before that rainy season comes... (distant stare).**

Well then.

**Let me set aside the paint talk for now.**

**Having become able to do color direction for collaborative works, I first got the mini-series *Robotex* and somehow managed to finish it.** Of the total 5 episodes, I was able to do color direction and check deliveries for 2 or 3 episodes... Even now I can't remember the story details (bitter laugh), but this became my first color direction work.

**Around the same time as *Robotex* production, I handled several collaborative works as per-episode color director.** First was *Transformers*. You know, trucks and trains that transform into robots. That work feels very Japanese-made now, but this was also American collaboration. Specifically, which series and which episodes I did - I can't tell anymore, but I handled several episodes.

**"Can't tell anymore..." because we were making so many, year after year.** Not just *Transformers* but series like *G.I. Joe* and *Muppet Babies*, starting production around summer each year to match American broadcast schedules, making about 50 episodes per series annually.

**So, *Transformers*.** Man, it was robot stuff (bitter laugh). Robot stuff, but somehow very human-like - well, the robots talked and acted (laughs). I've forgotten the stories too, but my impression was some cube or other, a pink or purple cube glowing with transmitted light, with flashy beam battles over it.

**Honestly, the animation was quite loose, so the moving images weren't particularly cool, and I remember not enjoying it that much... (bitter laugh).** Though last year I got hooked on robot stuff with *Gaiking: Legend of Daiku-Maryu (ガイキング LEGEND OF DAIKU-MARYU)* (laughs).

**Oh yes, speaking of *Transformers*, Toei Doga was making a theatrical version around then.** Directed by **Morishita Kozo (森下孝三)**. I think it was about a 2-hour epic. This one had perfectly cool animation - shadows with secondary shadows plus BL shadows, of course highlights galore - incredibly dense.

**For this theatrical version, I helped with checking finishing deliveries, and man, I remember it being incredibly difficult.** But I thought, if this gets done properly, it'll be amazing, while somewhat detachedly checking for color mismatches.

**Later, when I saw the completed footage (I think I saw it on video, not the first print...), it was spectacular.** Honestly, I've forgotten the plot of this too (explosion), but I was simply overwhelmed by the density that was completely different from the TV series *Transformers* I'd worked on. Ah, I want to see it again.

**Besides per-episode *Transformers* color direction, there were lots of small collaborative work commercials and such short projects, and I was handling those one after another.**

**Like this, day after day I was struggling with collaborative works that couldn't be seen in Japan, but suddenly things took a sharp turn - I ended up handling a domestic work.** Moreover, it was a theatrical work!

**The title was *GeGeGe no Kitaro: Yokai Daisenso (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎妖怪大戦争)*.**

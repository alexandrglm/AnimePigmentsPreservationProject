Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 124: Early Summer Special Edition - *The Tatami Galaxy* Notes for Color Direction Staff

Eh? Rain that seems like early rainy season continues in Tokyo. Still, once it clears, refreshing May winds. My, beer tastes good. ←That again? (laugh)

Now then.

*The Tatami Galaxy* currently broadcasting on Fuji TV's Thursday late-night "Noitamina" and other slots since April. I'm participating as color designer, and to great acclaim, this week's broadcast is already Episode 6 (Kanto area). We've reached exactly the halfway point of all 11 episodes.

So this time I'll write a bit about *The Tatami Galaxy*. Title: "*The Tatami Galaxy* Notes for Color Direction Staff."

Since work overview for *The Tatami Galaxy* has been specially featured and introduced on "WEB Anime Style," I'll omit that here and direct you there (laugh).

I first received this job offer during the thick of *STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* last autumn. I met Director Yuasa for the first time in November, and at that meeting we had rough discussions about character "colors."

"Simple. I want to keep it simple without using too many colors. Same with backgrounds—like putting one pop of color in black and white. And basically, no shadows."

That was Director Yuasa's first order. As character concepts, there were colored illustrations by Nakamura Yusuke, and based on those, Character Designer Ito Nobuyoshi rewrote them for animation. I received those character line art, and ah, they were truly simple!

Actually, I'd never done works with art styles this simple. I'd done a similarly simple character work called *Neighborhood Story* on TV quite a while back, but while those were simple line art, they had outfit changes every episode and were colorful—a work pursuing "fashion" above all. The complete opposite of this *Tatami Galaxy*.

Anyway, limiting colors, reducing color separation as much as possible, while picking up the original illustration atmosphere—those became those characters. Particularly protagonist "I" really came together with a "black and white" feeling.

Then Episode 1 began. I also handled color direction for Episode 1. "Ah, I see!" While working, various things gradually became visible. We tend to increase color count inevitably. By suppressing that, you can instead create various "colors" across entire scenes—or rather entire screens. Hmm, a bit abstract?

Based on Episode 1 impressions, I convey that "atmosphere" to color direction staff from Episode 2 onward.

For *The Tatami Galaxy*, once storyboards are complete, each episode's director centers meetings with the overall director, Art Director Uehara Shinichi, and me as color designer for "art board meetings." Once boards get general OK, art staff and color direction staff for each episode join "art board meeting" members for "art meetings." This art meeting also serves as color direction meeting, but after each scene's color design is complete, I have separate "color direction meetings" with color direction staff.

Various "notes" I conveyed to color direction staff during meetings. First, "simple." Props colors should all lean toward backgrounds. When animation shadows appear by scene, all borders should be wide gradation blend processing. And so on.

And among these, the most important note was "mob character silhouette processing." Oh, "mob characters" means passersby, shop customers—well, "everyone else" characters.

Those who've watched this work probably noticed we boldly use silhouette processing extensively. Like Episode 1's tennis scene, things "simplified" from animation stage are naturally designed with such screen intent, but other so-called "properly thoroughly animated" mob characters—we're doing quite bold things with "color." In most cases we do "single color flat painting" and such. Truly "simple." And this becomes quite important visual processing.

This work centers on "I," and we're basically watching that "I's" muttering from relatively close to "I"—that's the basic stance I consider. This "I" isn't very interested in things (people) not directly related to him currently. So we make them "silhouettes." By doing so, acting related to "I" becomes clear with "colors." Well, thinking such things, I ended up with that kind of "silhouette processing."

Color direction staff were apparently quite bewildered initially. We color direction staff have habits like "wanting to separate colors for things animated to be properly color-separated." With fairly realistic works common recently, having such animation before you naturally makes you want to add detailed colors. Then I'd say "one color is fine," and color direction staff naturally react "Eh? But... is that okay? Really just one color?" (laugh).

But when we actually tried single-color painting on animation cuts and showed them placed on backgrounds, everyone understood with "Ah, I see!" Incidentally, "what color to use for single-color painting" involves roughly explaining the target screen, then leaving it to color direction staff.

As always, my scene-by-scene color design is strictly framework, strictly blueprints. Color direction staff face actual cuts and handle actual key animation and director instructions. Moreover, this work has many cuts with non-designed key animation matching and special animation cuts coming up quite different from designs, plus various individual director instructions. I provide direction like "please unify in this feeling," and consider various things together with color direction staff, but how to cook that up depends on color direction staff's sense.

So please enjoy *The Tatami Galaxy* with that "color" aspect as one highlight too.

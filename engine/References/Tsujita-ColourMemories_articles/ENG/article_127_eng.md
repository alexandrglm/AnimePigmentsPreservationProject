Episode 127: All 11 Episodes Were Battle Episodes! *The Tatami Galaxy* Complete!

Writing this manuscript in the evening of June's final day, ah, half of this year has already ended today. Tomorrow begins this year's second half.

Ah, so fast (sweat).

Getting older, the flow of days really becomes too fast. It's becoming a standard complaint, but "it was just New Year's..." *The Tatami Galaxy*, which started in April, already has its final episode broadcasting this week (Kanto area)!

Hmm, too fast (sweat). There's definitely an accelerating trend year by year. Ah, will next year be even faster...?

Now then.

After about three nights of all-night work, *The Tatami Galaxy* final Episode 11 was completed the other morning. A Director Yuasa storyboard & direction episode. Truly an "all-out battle!" episode. *The Tatami Galaxy* is hereby complete.

Unfortunately it hasn't aired yet so I'll refrain from detailed content discussion, but watching the full-length sound all-rushes before video editing, I got a bit emotional. Having stayed close to "I" throughout and created colors for "I's" story, I probably ended up feeling like "I." With final rushes completed, giving OK to the old book fair "I" and Akashi-san cuts and completing the master. Going home, I cried a little.

One-cour TV series (especially this *Tatami Galaxy* with all 11 episodes) really is over in a flash—short. During my Toei days I mostly participated in long TV works lasting a year or more, so that short feeling is especially pronounced.

But being short with few episodes, everything was unquestionably a "battle episode." Long works continuing 3-4 cours have weaker episodes due to series composition pacing. But this *Tatami Galaxy* had all 11 battle episodes. While various things happened, all 11 episodes felt like everyone gave their all.

Having fought through such 11 battle episodes, I'm quite spaced out now. Ah, I can't get my hands on other work (sweat). I want to rest just two more days, at least until the final episode broadcast ends... Ah, eh? That's not allowed? Hmm.

Well, feeling somewhat "spaced out" like that, this week is extremely short.

Oh, Thursday late night "Noitamina" this week apparently has broadcast time moved back 10 minutes, so be careful. There are final episode-specific devices, so please look forward to it. Everyone, please support us until the end.

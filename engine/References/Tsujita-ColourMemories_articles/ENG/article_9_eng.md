## **Episode 9: Once Upon a Time... (7) The Forbidden "X" Paints**

**It's warm. It's spring.** Tokyo is already warm enough that the cherry blossoms seem ready to bloom. The cherry trees in Shakujii Park also seem to be showing a pinkish tint overall.

**The problem is what clothes to wear.** During the day it's so warm that I actually spend time in studios wearing T-shirts, but temperatures still drop considerably after evening, so if you're not careful you'll catch cold (laughs). But once you've spent the day in a T-shirt, putting on another layer becomes bothersome (bitter laugh). Hmm.

**Incidentally, I don't have hay fever, so I'm saved in that regard (laughs).**

Well then.

**Having joined Toei Doga, I inevitably had to deal with Stack color paints whether I liked it or not.**

**Toei Doga divided paints into three groups.**

**First, about 120 colors for regular TV works.** Next, about 70 special colors for theatrical works called **"X (Ekkusu) colors."** And about 70-plus special colors for American "collaborative works" called **"A colors"** (numbered like "A-1").

**TV work basic colors had about 5 gradation levels for each color,** organized as a super-average, well-balanced chart that could be used for any work. I once heard that Toei Doga's art department decided this chart saying "Like this..." and Stack made paints according to it, but I'm not sure about that since I never confirmed it (laughs).

**"X colors" were gradually added as needed when making theatrical works, since TV basic colors alone weren't sufficient.** Incidentally, several colors numbered "X-51" and above were exceptions - when we took over collaborative works that other companies had been handling, these were colors formulated to match Taiyo Shikisai paints, so these exceptionally had compatibility with Taiyo colors. For example, "X-54" was like Taiyo Shikisai's "200G."

**"A colors" were made to match model paints when color models (color sample cels) sent from America had colors not available in Toei's paints.** For example, "A-7" was *Spider-Man*'s bodysuit color, something like that.

**Back then, Toei Doga was constantly making several lines of TV series, but regardless of content direction, all works decided colors based on this basic TV color chart.** It certainly was a well-balanced color chart, but inevitably everything ended up with similar atmospheres. Since the basics were all vivid, strong colors, even things that should have been intermediate color schemes were forcibly assigned and arranged. "Bandai colors" was well said - all clear colors like those used for toys. For example, red (B-3), blue (CB-4), yellow (Y-3) were standard.

**Ideally, rather than every work using the same color chart, we'd arrange usage colors according to each work's tendencies** - like making this work's chart heavy in earth colors, or preparing lots of blue color variations for this work.

**Anyway, for TV works we could only use colors from this basic chart of about 120 colors.** But naturally, we wanted to use "X" and other paints too (laughs). However, using "X" or especially "A" would get you severely scolded by company superiors. Finishing productions would also complain.

**Certainly, from work or color direction perspectives, using "X" at key points would definitely look better,** but that meant increasing the number of colors used for painting. Increasing paint colors meant finishing productions had to prepare those colors, costing extra materials. With finishing work unit costs that weren't high, there were harsh realities.

**So for example, in character color decision meetings, spreading color sample cels and color chart sheets to decide things, directors and we color directors wanted to use "X" colors.** But we weren't allowed. If we could use this "X color" here, it would be perfect... such conflicts unfolded.

**Toei Doga TV works back then included some categorized as "shadowless works,"** where even if animation had shadows, finishing didn't need to add shadows by agreement. With cel finishing, adding shadows meant painting required double work - shadow tracing, shadow painting - taking double time. But unit costs were naturally TV rates, burdening finishing productions. So by agreement, "shadowless was OK."

**This continued even for *Sailor Moon*.**

**However, with the flow of time, more works requiring "shadows" even for TV anime increased.** Not just adding shadows to raise visual grade, but many characters arranged different colors in shadow colors from normal color gradations to create atmosphere when deciding character colors. In this context, "X colors" came to be used normally on TV.

**Also, the shift of finishing work sites from domestic productions to overseas studios was significant.**

Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 120: Once Upon a Time... (68) Continued: 1994

It's April, and numerous new anime programs are starting one after another, and among them are three lines of programs I'm participating in.

First is *Mary & Galy Ver. 2.0* on NHK Educational TV that started March 30th.

This is the second season of *Mary & Galy*, which had been broadcasting to great acclaim since last spring.

In the first season I could only participate in main character color design, but this season I'm deeply involved and handled color direction for most episodes. I made it with considerable enthusiasm. Yes, actually this season's broadcast content is mostly completed. That's the strength of 5-minute anime (laugh).

It broadcasts within "Science Ranger" every Tuesday at 6:55 PM. Plus reruns every Saturday at 10 AM. Both on NHK Educational TV. And even on General TV every Thursday at 4:05 PM! Wow, nationwide broadcast!

Next is *Ultra!! Mecha-Mote Chairman Second Collection*. This is also the second season of "Ultra!! Mecha-Mote Chairman" which had been broadcasting to great acclaim since last spring. Continuing from the first season, I'm participating in color design and various other roles. This second season starting April 3rd became a full 3DCG work, with background art completely renewed in style! New rival characters also appear for even more fashionable upgrade!

Broadcasting Saturdays at 9 AM on TV Tokyo network to great acclaim.

And *The Tatami Galaxy*, beginning broadcast April 22nd late night on Fuji TV's "Noitamina"! Director Yuasa Masaaki's work—known to those who know (I think?). I handled color design and color direction for the first episode. I've participated in quite various anime over the years, but wow, this is a first of its type. Every episode during all-rushes, I forget to check the screen and get completely absorbed watching (laugh).

Please support all three of these series!

Now then.

*Dragon Ball Z Movie: The Galaxy at the Brink! The Super Incredible Guy*. Working with Director Yamauchi for the first time in two years since *Crying Freeman 5: The Battlefield Demon*. This was my first *Dragon Ball* with Yamauchi-san.

My first *Dragon Ball Z* theatrical in two years myself. Goten, Trunks, Videl—starting by grasping characters who'd multiplied while I wasn't looking. Hm? And Broly too? Apparently he'd appeared as a theatrical original character around the previous year. I heard this was a character who appeared in Yamauchi-san's directed work.

For now, I obtained color direction from TV series team and materials room to create color samples for this theatrical version. As I wrote last time, since I was plotting to develop colors as theatrical *Dragon Ball Z*, I built up Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo and others based on theatrical color direction from when I'd handled them before, and also organized and corrected regular characters like Goten and Trunks appearing from this time in my approach as "theatrical basic color direction" while considering future prospects.

Goten is basically the same as Goku, so mostly the same color direction. For Trunks, TV color direction had almost no difference between normal and shadow hair, so I made normal colors somewhat brighter and adjusted shadow colors so hair color could be felt. Then I strengthened overall shadow color density (brightness) for better contrast.

And then these guys also become Super Saiyans and such (wry laugh).

Super Saiyan apparently means energy built up inside the body wells up and overflows from inside to outside. So I imagined something like those human-shaped mannequins in department store women's underwear sections with lightbulbs inside, where the whole body glows from within. I brightened character colors overall and didn't drop shadow colors deeply—rather set them bright with almost no difference feeling. On top of that, I set the slightly animated secondary shadows slightly darker to aim for character muscle three-dimensionality.

And Broly. This was senior Sakamoto Yoko-san's work from his previous appearance. She handled colors for works like *Magical Taruruuto-kun*, so pastel color usage was her characteristic. I remade this toward my approach—or rather my style—for this work, but since this character had already been released once, I couldn't go completely 180 degrees opposite colors. While glaring at the original and seeking more powerful volume, I tried creating a new Broly.

Yamauchi director's works are first and foremost "light acting." Between the director and me, theatrical *Saint Seiya: Legend of Crimson Youth* serves as one standard, and this *The Galaxy at the Brink! The Super Incredible Guy* is no different. So when light is emitted, recipients always receive it—characters and spaces surrounding characters change in color and shadow under that light's influence.

This time too was packed with "technique" light acting that Broly manipulates, plus "Kamehameha waves" surpassing that. Anyway, preparing 2-3 types of materials and overlapping, doubling, making them glow with supers and transmitted light—using every possible technique.

What materials should be prepared to achieve such footage? Each time working with Yamauchi director, I became more knowledgeable about photography techniques. Eventually I ended up adding quite a lot of photography instructions from my end, and photography staff's work gradually becoming quite demanding became fairly normal.

The cel and film full analog era. Moreover, complex photography takes that much more time, and you can't reshoot many times. Even preparing materials meticulously for shooting often didn't achieve intended screens. Each time requesting retakes, or having to give "OK" even with slightly different nuances.

In today's digital era, you can simulate on your own computer monitor, so screens can generally be built to strike zone feeling, but 1994 was still an era with no hint of such a convenient world's arrival.

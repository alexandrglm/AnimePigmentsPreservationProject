## Episode 104: Captured by Pirates!!

Autumn has fully arrived, with mornings and evenings getting quite chilly. Simultaneously, extreme dryness... My nose and throat wake up parched and dry, and while I'm not catching a cold, I'm troubled by nasally wake-up voice...

That "new type" seems to be going around lately.

Fortunately, no one around me has been hit by the "new type," but it feels like something to be cautious about.

...As I write this, I'm still wearing just a T-shirt, but I need to be careful about health management.

Now then.

Today's Tokyo was blessed with wonderful clear weather after the typhoon, but I'm caught in a situation completely unrelated to such things.

Yes, I've been captured by pirates!

I'm imprisoned under a legendary pirate called "Golden Lion Shiki." The reason this series has been delayed these past 2-3 weeks is because I've actually been kidnapped and confined by pirates.

I can't say much in detail, but the Navy suffered tremendous damage before "Golden Lion Shiki's" "powers."

I can only wait for Luffy and the "Straw Hat Pirates" to come rescue me and defeat Shiki as soon as possible.

So I'll probably remain captured by pirates a while longer, please forgive me (tears).

Such theatrical *ONE PIECE FILM STRONG WORLD* opens December 12th! Please look forward to it!

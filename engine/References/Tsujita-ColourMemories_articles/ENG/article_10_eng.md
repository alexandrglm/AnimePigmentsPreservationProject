# **Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]**

## **Episode 10: Special Episode... I'm in Seoul**

**Since yesterday (Monday), I've been in Seoul, Korea.** For meetings regarding the work I'm currently participating in, *Taichi Senjimon (太極千字文)*.

**This work is a TV series for Korean broadcast, where the Japanese side (Toei Animation) handles everything from scenarios to storyboards and character/art designs, while Korean production companies handle the actual animation production work.** Yes, it's "collaborative work."

**Based on the setting materials we Japanese staff created, the Korean side cooks and expands everything to complete it for broadcast.**

**First, broadcast in Korea is scheduled to start in April, and production is already well underway.** This meeting is for various confirmations and considerations of questions and requests from each part - direction, animation, etc.

**The group includes producer, director, character designer, mecha designer, and others - 8 people total.** Until tomorrow (Wednesday), it'll be quite a dense Seoul stay.

**Our group that arrived in Seoul at noon immediately went to the production site after lunch with the production company people who came to meet us.**

**The location is in a newly developed district in one corner of Seoul city.** Many glass-walled high-rise office buildings stand in rows. Many Korean animation production companies have gathered in this district, all located in these high-rise office buildings. Man, it's completely different from Japan (laughs).

**But once you step into the studio, it's still an anime production site.** Mountains of piled cut bags, posters on walls, staff working at desks and monitors, and staff napping on folding beds nearby. Ah, it's the same (laughs).

**After a general tour, Korean and Japanese staff gathered in a meeting room to start discussions.** We had passionate meetings for nearly 5 hours, far exceeding the originally planned time. After all, communication between staff is fundamental to anime production. It's fun meeting and talking with site staff. I was considering giving up this business trip because of all the difficult work I'm carrying, but man, I'm glad I came!

**Today, the second day, after observing the dubbing site, we returned to the studio for more meetings.**

**This *Taichi Senjimon* broadcast in Japan is still undecided, but I hope broadcast in Japan gets decided soon.**

**So sorry, this time was such a Seoul business trip diary (sweat).**

# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 65: Once Upon a Time... (42) - "R-2" Is Purple - The Trap (bitter laugh)

Before I knew it, it's October (sweat).

This past weekend, I went to meet my favorite paintings. The "Vermeer Exhibition" currently showing with great acclaim at Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum in Ueno.

The genius painter Johannes Vermeer, who left only about thirty works in his lifetime. Seven of his works scattered around the world have been gathered and are on display. My beloved work "The Love Letter" unfortunately didn't come to Japan, but it was still a completely satisfying Vermeer exhibition.

Ah, seeing the real thing in person is truly amazing! While they're incredible in art books and catalogs too, when you photograph them and then print them, they inevitably become different. The delicate, soft light and the atmosphere and sense of depth expressed through it can truly be appreciated for their original splendor only by seeing the actual works with your own eyes.

I had goosebumps the entire time.

So, the Netherlands!

I've been thinking about this for the past few years - I really should go to Amsterdam to see paintings. Rembrandt is Dutch too! I must go! A trip to the Netherlands to see the real things is decided.

...Well, before that I need to subdue the work I'm currently struggling with. And when that's finished, I'll probably think "First, hot springs!" (bitter laugh).

Well then.

Color direction work for theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors* began in earnest in January 1992 after the new year.

First I'd do normal STAC color direction for the Philippines Manila studio under Toei Doga (at the time), but eventually production said "We'd like to send some to Korea soon." So Taiyo Shikisai color direction also started from there. Daily flights went out through contractors to Manila. Until evening flight departure, Manila studio STAC color direction. Then from evening until late night, Korean Taiyo Shikisai color direction. This continued daily.

Usually, we'd make a bound booklet "color direction book" for each work and give it to finishing contractors for work, but when requesting Korean work, since it was completely animation finishing (adding color direction to key animation, then having animation→finishing work and sending back) contracting, we used the method of including copies of all necessary character color directions for each cut (inserting into time sheets). If everything needed for that cut was included with that cut, there would be less wasted searching or painting with wrong color directions, we thought.

Copies inserted into cuts were naturally color direction books created by converting to Taiyo Shikisai colors. Initially we considered giving them a "STAC→Taiyo Shikisai paint conversion table" and having them convert and paint STAC color directions themselves, but that would be tremendously troublesome work for them, and complexity would increase error likelihood. As I may have written before, STAC and Taiyo Shikisai colors have completely different color tones but the same numbers - extremely dangerous colors. So we thought it would be more reliable to specify in Taiyo Shikisai from the start.

But still, it's human work. There were inevitably some mistakes. Well, such mistakes were often color direction errors.

That's right. Sometimes I'd accidentally mix STAC and Taiyo Shikisai specifications. The copies inserted into cuts were error-free, but the problem was when I directly wrote paint numbers on key animation for color direction. Then I'd accidentally write the wrong numbers (bitter laugh).

For example, there's a color called "R-2" often used for skin shadow colors, which we converted to a Taiyo color called "R-70M." But I'd accidentally do it - write "R-2" on Taiyo Shikisai cuts.

So what happens? The skin shadow colors come back painted purple. And when I make mistakes, I tend to make them in batches, so multiple cuts come back with purple skin...

Each time I'd hold my head while apologetically taking retake work to the coloring team.

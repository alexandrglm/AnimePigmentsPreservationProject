# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 70: Side Story - More Promotion! *Theatrical GeGeGe no Kitaro: Japan Explodes!!*

November means "Tori no Ichi" (Rooster Market). This year there seem to be three rooster days.

Oh. I learned just 2-3 years ago that "Tori no Ichi" and "O-Tori-sama" aren't nationwide customs/festivals. What a surprise - they're Tokyo local. Native Tokyo people tend to unconsciously assume things done in Tokyo must be nationwide (laugh).

Every November on "Rooster Days," markets are held at shrines. At those market stalls you buy lucky bamboo rakes for business prosperity and offer rakes bought the previous year to the shrine. Tokyo has such events.

Somehow, Tori no Ichi makes my heart race. Memories of being taken to Shinjuku Hanazono Shrine's Tori no Ichi as a child resurface from deep in my body, and even at this age I get excited and restless.

There's a shrine near my house where Tori no Ichi is held, but my "O-Tori-sama roots" are definitely Hanazono Shrine. That crowded night market is irresistibly good. I don't actually buy rakes, but the clapping between sellers and customers that happens each time a rake sells makes me so happy.

However, last year and the year before, I was constantly chased by work during this period and couldn't go out, which was quite lonely. Same this year - "Ni no Tori" (second rooster day) has already ended.

"San no Tori" (third rooster day) is at month's end.

Will I be able to go to Tori no Ichi this year? (laugh)

Well then.

*Theatrical GeGeGe no Kitaro: Japan Explodes!!* releasing next month (December 20th) is finally in production's last spurt!

"Huh? It's still not finished? (sweat)" - such comments are prohibited (laugh).

Being swamped by that work's final push, I dropped last week's serialization manuscript again. Sorry to all readers.

Well...

Since I'm dropping manuscripts at last week's situation level, being even busier this week, I naturally can't concentrate on writing other topics (explosion), so this week is also promotional special part 2 for *Theatrical GeGeGe no Kitaro: Japan Explodes!!* that I'm currently battling.

My work on this *Theatrical GeGeGe no Kitaro: Japan Explodes!!* is color design, color direction, and inspection for the main story of about 80+ minutes plus the roughly 3-minute short *GeGeGe Festival! The Five Great Kitaros* that plays briefly before the main story begins.

As you all know, the *GeGeGe no Kitaro* TV series is currently airing with great acclaim, and color design for that is handled by Itasaka Yasue-san. While colors for Kitaro, Neko-musume, and many demons are already established in the TV series, do we use those as-is for the theatrical version? Actually, no.

TV series colors are made somewhat brighter for TV screens. TV screens and theatrical film screenings have different color (or brightness) expression ranges, so theatrical works need screens made with appropriate colors.

Also, TV series has flexible design to handle various episodes unfolding weekly with maximum common denominator adaptability, but theatrical versions can specialize for just that one episode, requiring color design focused only on that story's content.

So my first job was converting each character's TV series colors for this theatrical use.

First, deciding the protagonist Kitaro's colors.

For any work, I set key characters and create the [basic][foundation] centered on those characters. For Kitaro, color combinations were already decided, so I adjusted brightness and color saturation while maintaining that balance. First lowering brightness and saturation somewhat uniformly, then raising sunken colors and restraining excessive colors through trial and error. Just like a balance scale.

The result was somewhat lower saturation and brightness compared to TV color direction, with added depth to shadow colors. I also restrained the yellowish tones in skin color compared to the TV series.

"White" brightness is also a major key. For characters, white of eyes and teeth become the brightest, closest to "White," and how to set those values becomes a major factor.

Kitaro's eye whites in the TV series appear to be [RGB:244.244.244], but for this theatrical version I set them to [228.228.228]. This [RGB:228.228.228] looks quite gray when viewed alone, but it just needs to look white in balance with skin. I adjusted overall balance with that sense.

Incidentally, for this time's guest character Kazamatsuri Hana, to make her skin look fair, conversely from that skin color balance, her eye whites are brighter than Kitaro's at [233.233.233].

Oh, Medama-oyaji's "eye whites" are handled separately (laugh).

So after first deciding Kitaro, I next created Hana-chan's colors. Then using those two as the axis, I adjusted other regular characters' colors while creating original theatrical characters' colors.

Whether creating new colors or converting from TV versions, I first consider individual character personalities while being conscious of character distinctiveness balance to create colors for each character individually. Then I adjust balance considering combinations with other characters in appearance scenes. I endlessly repeat such processes.

So the color directions I created for this theatrical version totaled over 200! (laugh)

Too many demons! (bitter laugh)

Who exactly thought up "47 Demon Warriors"? (bitter laugh)

When I handled color design for *Ojamajo Doremi* previously, main character color directions created in the first two years didn't reach 200, showing how many this number is. Moreover, I also create special coloring color directions for individual scenes, so adding those approaches 400? Or more? This was definitely my theatrical work record for most color directions (laugh).

This is still just the first part of my work. The real battle is color direction and inspection of completed coloring. The battle finally enters the front lines.

To be continued next time!

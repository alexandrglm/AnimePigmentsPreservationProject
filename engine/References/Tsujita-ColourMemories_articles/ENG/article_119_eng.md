Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 119: Once Upon a Time... (67) 1994, Between TV Series and Theatrical Versions

Cherry blossoms! ...That's what I was saying last week, but Tokyo has gotten thoroughly cold again. While the bloom declaration came out, subsequent cold snaps mean even this final weekend of March still has cherry blossoms at only 20-30% bloom. The real hanami day will probably be around this weekend.

In such mood, I had a slight bicycle accident and injured my left foot, so I'm living while dragging one leg (cry). Ah, if the swelling doesn't go down soon, I won't be able to sit properly at hanami banquet seats! Heal quickly, my foot!

And come quickly, full cherry blossoms!

Now then.

1993 ended with *Sailor Moon R* movie. After completion and the wrap party, I remember taking time off and traveling to Hokkaido. I think I was around Kushiro on opening day. Wait? Which opening was that? *Sailor Moon R*? *Coo*?

That year ultimately became a theatrical work year with completing *Coo* and *Sailor Moon R* movie. Having been removed from TV series lines, I was becoming even more specialized for theatrical works.

Into 1994. My first job was again a theatrical work: *Dragon Ball Z Movie: The Galaxy at the Brink! The Super Incredible Guy*.

Script: Koyama Takao, Animation Director: Yamamuro Tadayoshi, Art Setting: Kubota Tadao, Art Director: Tokushige Masaru, and Director: Yamauchi Shigeyasu. Strictly speaking, when *Sailor Moon R* movie ended I'd already received the scenario and rough characters, but actual work began in January after New Year's.

My first *Dragon Ball Z* movie in two years. Good grief, without my knowing, the kids had multiplied!

I hadn't been involved with TV series *Dragon Ball Z* at all, so I actually hadn't watched the TV show or even properly read the original comics. That's precisely why theatrical work was always fresh for me.

But characters who'd already appeared on TV had established consensus among viewers about their colors, so naturally the theatrical version had to match TV. So I'd obtain TV color direction and begin work.

As before, TV color direction was naturally made for TV and couldn't be used as-is for theatrical works created with movie theater screens in mind. So as before, including during *Sailor Moon R*, I always did correction work on shadow balance and such when producing theatrical versions of TV series works.

It was similar this time, but I suddenly thought: *Dragon Ball Z* theatrical versions would probably continue being made at twice-yearly pace, and that work would probably come to me. In that case, wouldn't it be fine to develop theatrical-specific color approaches and development?

"That work would probably come to me"—thinking such things was arrogant, and I think "I was young" (wry laugh), but somehow I was thinking such things then. I actually was young (laugh).

That didn't mean character colors and visuals would change drastically between TV and theatrical versions—such things would be impossible while actually handling the work (laugh).

However, regarding taking on just theatrical versions of TV works where others handled basic design, there were various pressures and considerations I had to be mindful of, and regarding such personal internal problems, I strongly held such thinking to push through and clear my head.

So from around this time I openly declared—or rather proclaimed—"TV and theatrical are separate things!"

Even so, neither then nor recently have TV staff ever complained about this or that, and I put good pressure on myself thinking "I have to work solidly so they won't have complaints!"

Honestly, some TV colors had color direction that made me think "Eh? These colors are a bit..." but even including that, they were TV colors built up over long periods, and that "color" became the base for expanding worlds that became popular enough for theatrical versions. So I've always deeply respected TV series "colors" and "worlds."

And on top of that, "Let's build theatrical versions as theatrical worlds!"—that feeling remains unchanged in me even after over ten years.

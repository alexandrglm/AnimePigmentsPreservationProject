Episode 129: Sorry, Another Special Edition - *The Tatami Galaxy* Kyoto Local Post-Production Location Tour

*The Tatami Galaxy*, which received great acclaim, has completed not only broadcast work but also all work on unreleased episodes for BD & DVD release. With a little time available, I'm taking a brief vacation. Ah, travel for the first time in a while. I'm in Kyoto bustling with the Gion Festival, camera in hand.

But, rain. Western Japan generally seems to have heavy rain tendencies since the week's start, and Kyoto too feels properly like the end of rainy season, getting hit by daily evening showers. Plus it's muggily hot during the day without clearing up completely. And humidity. Good grief.

Still, I'm enjoying my first vacation in a while.

Now then.

Right after receiving the *Tatami Galaxy* job offer last autumn, before my actual work started, I went to Kyoto twice for self-funded location scouting. At that time I toured important *Tatami Galaxy* locations like Kamogawa Delta, Kamo Bridge, Shimogamo Shrine and Tadasu Forest, plus the Kiyamachi area, grasping the atmosphere in my own way before diving into main production work.

Then main production work started. As Episodes 2, 3, 4... progressed, various locations kept appearing. All fascinating places. Plus locations I hadn't covered in self-funded scouting came one after another. I became irresistibly curious about the source material for the spatial worlds created for animation.

So this time, though belated, I've toured several locations I felt deeply about among places that served as story stage references. Title: "*Tatami Galaxy* Kyoto Local Post-Production Location Tour" (laugh). Ah, just like an anime fan (laugh).

First, naturally revisiting Kamogawa Delta and Kamo Bridge.

With big rain effects, the Kamogawa River was in major flood. The stepping stone turtles you can walk across the Kamogawa were magnificently submerged. More water than during Gozan no Okuribi night fires? If you fell in here you wouldn't survive, Ozu (sweat).

I bought "bean mochi" that appeared in the main feature from famous Futaba shop in Demachiyanagi shopping district and ate them sitting on Delta benches. Delicious!

Crossing Kamo Bridge eastward and walking straight leads to Hyakumanben intersection. Beyond that on the right spreads Kyoto University campus. Walking through that campus toward the main gate. Walking through university grounds where young people pass as such an old guy is a bit nerve-wracking (laugh).

The clock tower that appeared almost every episode, used as visual reference for the university "I" attends. It was surprisingly small. I thought it towered more magnificently. In the main feature screen it's shown quite majestically large. Incidentally, the tree in front is camphor. In Episode 1 we showed it cherry blossom-like for entrance ceremony imagery.

Exiting Kyoto University's main gate and turning left, just ahead is Yoshida Mountain. Yoshida Shrine.

This is the spot used for filming by film club "Misogi" led by Jogasaki. It was so close to university campus!

Beyond Yoshida Shrine's main hall is a small mountain. In this mountain, just over the summit on the side opposite the shrine, is Cafe "Moan."

This was used as reference for the spot where "I" and Hanuki-san had their tea date after Conversation Club. Actually, I'd been curious about this place since main production work and had wanted to visit forever! This atmosphere is wonderful! I had delicious lunch.

Leaving Yoshida Mountain, going down Shirakawa Street, the final spot I reached was here: Lake Biwa Canal, Keage Incline.

I had no idea such a thing existed in Kyoto until working on this project. I didn't understand Lake Biwa Canal well in the first place. Actually gazing from the bridge where "I" stood in Episode 3, I was moved with "Ooooh!" Further moved seeing the boat pool wall that "I" crashed into with his human-powered aircraft (laugh).

Still, Akashi-san ran alongside here by bicycle, right? Even with a mountain bike, that's incredible.

Incidentally, this canal connected to Nanzenji's aqueduct, that mecca of suspense drama filming locations.

Well, touring places I felt deeply about like that. I really understood the feelings of fans doing "local pilgrimages"! This kind of thing is fun!

I got so emotionally invested in *The Tatami Galaxy*, but this finally gave me emotional closure. This "post-production location tour" was also for such "closure." Work and feelings are hereby finished. My feelings will now enter new works.

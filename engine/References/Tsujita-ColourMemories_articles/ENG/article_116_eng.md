Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 116: It's March Already But... New Year Special Edition - *STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* Notes (Final Part 2) "SW" Main Feature Complete Scene Color Design Notes! Part 1

Aaaaaah! March (sob). I was so busy I kept missing deadlines, and February ended before I knew it. Sorry! > All concerned parties

The cause of that busyness is various projects colliding, truly leaving no time to sleep. I'd love to promote everything here, but unfortunately some things still can't be discussed... Among those, what's been opened to the public in a big way is *The Tatami Galaxy*.

The PV has started being released. The broadcast date was finally decided. Please look forward to this too!

■Scene 1: Navy Headquarters

"Hey, who's Garp?" I asked. "Apparently he's Luffy's grandfather," said Kobiki-san. "Why is a pirate's grandpa in the Navy?" "Who knows?"... Well, design work for one scene started with that kind of conversation (laugh). This scene was used in the trailer too, but the trailer colors were strictly "temporary." For the main feature I recreated them from scratch.

The goal was an impressive "bright red" as the hook, unified in red that felt pink rather than orange. The CG island ship was made heavily black for weight and presence. For this scene I handed Kobiki-san colors I'd adjusted from the trailer cuts with a "Well then, please handle it!" feeling (laugh).

■Scene 2: Summer Island Jungle

Luffy's entrance. This scene of jungle monster battles was designed with strong summer-like contrast.

The dust clouds in the jungle were deliberately made somewhat bright. Thinking realistically, since it's jungle it would be more humid, and the dust clouds themselves would be more ground-colored. I tried that approach initially, but it blended too much with the monsters and somehow felt off—the atmosphere didn't match the animation. Since the photography policy was also not to double-expose (not make transparent), maybe dry ground dust cloud colors would be better? So the dust cloud colors became the same dry colors as the dust clouds in the later plaza battle against Teroguma.

I actually like these three scenes best in the main feature. They overflow with that "What? What? What? What's starting?" feeling.

■Scenes 3-5: Autumn Island Ruins

When I saw the art boards from Waki-san, the autumn leaves were so vivid and bright that I went "Ugh! (sweat)" and thought maybe we'd have to tone down the color saturation somewhat. But when actually shot, it settled really well, had great contrast, and became a good point in the main feature's introduction. Ah, as expected, amazing, well calculated.

This scene is basically painted with so-called "normal" color direction. Based on the balance with the previous scene and the art around here, I decided the basic normal color balance for the main feature.

Incidentally, the army ants swarming out—those are almost entirely CG. Only a few animation cuts. I added colors to 2D designs and handed them over, and modeling and coloring were based on those.

■Scene 6: Opening

"Make it look like a color chart screen"—that was the director's order. The meeting was just that, and I was allowed to freely create the rest—that opening. One-cut processing. I applied color direction to an incredibly thick bundle of key animation with "here goes!" reflexes. After it was painted, while watching the screen flow, I repainted and corrected with another "here goes!" feeling. About an hour for color direction. About five hours for painted correction and final repainting work. Photography was handled by the CG department. A one-shot gamble that got an OK!

Actually, this opening was so close to the deadline with no time that there wasn't leisure to work carefully—that was the reality. In result, I think that worked out well. This kind of screen, this kind of work, this kind of result—I quite like it personally.

■Scene 7: Shiki's Palace Greenhouse Pool

From the opening the screen moves directly to the indoor pool. Also "normal" color direction here. It's the proper introduction scene for Shiki's group. For the entrance dance, based on the storyboard, movement was first created with 3D dummy models and frame printouts were made for the duration. Using those as foundation, character animation (key animation) was placed on top, proceeding through in-between animation to finishing in 2D workflow. This was quite troublesome—the movement animation itself was fine, but the facial in-betweens were catastrophic (wry laugh). Some cuts had animation corrected twice (but the ones that couldn't be fixed are a secret).

■Scenes 8-15: Sunny Deck to Island Ship Bridge, Storm Arrival

The flashback scene about why Nami was brought to the palace.

The 3D Sunny was created for TV series, but I modified colors and textures for theatrical use. I provided modification proposals for colors, Special Effects' Ota-kun added texture retouch samples to that data, and based on those, CG department staff reflected them in the main feature. Incidentally, the island ship had CG models created based on designs by Art Setting's Sato Masahiro, and CG models were completed using textures prepared by the art department combined with island ships drawn by Waki-san as art design.

For Sunny deck characters, I initially thought about strengthening shadow density for more contrast, but when I made color samples, they looked somewhat dirty so I stopped. Nami's white tank top chest shadows just wouldn't look clean. Chopper's expression also became harsh (laugh), and Nami's the lead (laugh). So this too was basically "normal" color direction. Storm scenes and the closed island ship bridge had overall saturation and brightness lowered.

The island ship bridge crew (pirates) were also created by Kobiki-san. Among them was one character set as "Shiki's Subordinate A," but he looked like talent Wacky and was quite eye-catching—ah, maybe I should have made his colors more similar too.

■Scene 16: Shiki's Palace Greenhouse Pool

Billy's entrance. Billy's colors are actually TV series color designer Horita-kun's colors. Before I joined this project, colors apparently had to be released first for games or something, so Horita-kun had provided colors for Shiki and Billy. I remade Shiki and others my way, but since Oda-san said Billy was good as-is, I used it unchanged.

For pool scene Nami's hair, while animation expressed wetness, wondering if we could add another touch, Special Effects added glossy processing to highlight areas. Plus I asked for highlight brush processing on Nami's eyes as much as possible. This was also Special Effects' Ota-kun's handiwork. Considering whether Nami's inner strength could be expressed through her eyes, though the volume was large, I requested it. Nami's the lead after all (laugh).

■Scenes 17-23: Spring Island to Resident Island, Xiao's House

The monsters—ah, they're fun! My favorites are Cowball (the ones that shoot out from cherry tree branches) and Toramata. I briefly thought about secretly using Toramata for New Year's cards, but that would obviously be problematic so I didn't (laugh).

Around the winter zone monster battles, the snow in the backgrounds that came up was unexpectedly light brown. Since it was supposed to be a desaturated scene, that was OK, but there was a slight problem. While the background looked properly like snow even in light brown, if I matched that color to create animated (cel) snow, the cel version just looked like dirt (wry laugh). So I deliberately didn't match cel-drawn snow and snow clouds to the background and made them white snow.

Xiao's grandmother's illness "spots" and Nami's spots later were all Special Effects handiwork. Base parts were created on separate cels and processed.

■Scenes 25-26, 30: Pirates Gathered at Port to Palace Command Room

Matching pirate captain colors, command room pirates and navigators—this area was all Kobiki-san work.

Inside the command room, character brightness was suppressed to match background brightness. Even in dim places, it's brightness that looks natural through balance.

Den Den Mushi wandering the village, plus Den Den Mushi appearing in island ship bridge and command room—also Kobiki-san work. When I make them they tend toward realistic, so I asked her to aim for a manga-like feel. The unbalanced feeling creates good atmosphere.

■Scene 24, 27: Palace Pool to Merveille Sea to Caldera Lake Island

Nami and Billy's escape and reunion with Luffy. Nami's swimsuit—I actually made a slight mistake. This swimsuit has black and white vertical stripes, but when I created the painting settings, the bra straps were mixed between white and black ones in full-body and close-up images. So the painted results were inconsistent (cry). I sent them to photography without noticing and created lots of retakes. Incidentally, it's a secret that some cuts weren't completely fixed (wry laugh).

The scorpion meat Luffy grills and eats used grilled crab as reference (laugh). Incidentally, I don't really like crab.

■Scenes 28, 29: Wasteland, Xiao's Village

This area is also basically all "normal" color direction.

■Scenes 31, 33: Wasteland Tavern

Inside the tavern, overall brightness was suppressed to match backgrounds with lighting redness (or rather yellow-orange) added. Pirates and food were Kobiki-san work, plus Special Effects added appetizing textures.

Pirate Kitajima appears. Ah, Kitajima! For promotional reasons, Kitajima's participation was suddenly decided. I was suddenly handed the character and created it with "here goes!" momentum, but thinking back, various things were awkward. He was supposedly a fishman tribally, but actually no other fishmen appeared in the main feature besides Kitajima—I should have put more fishman-type pirates among the mob.

Also Saito Aiko-chan's Xiao's sister Ever. This was also suddenly communicated as "that's how it became!" (sweat). Since that wasn't my intention, if I'd known earlier, I had more ideas to make her cuter (oops).

■Scene 32: Xiao's House

The scene where Nami overhears Xiao's family conversation and becomes upset. Originally I planned to make characters in the room darker for evening atmosphere, but since the outdoor scene just before wasn't particularly westering sun, and the animation had large shadow areas, I unified it normally. Photography added various atmosphere.

■Scene 34: Xiao's Village, Sunset Battle

First half climax. This scene divides into two color groupings: the orange sunset "Sunset Color B" during the big battle with Shiki, and "Afterglow Color" for when Nami submits.

The battle scene "Sunset Color B" appeared briefly in the trailer, but I remade it for the main feature. In the trailer version, character color volume was overwhelmed by the cool backgrounds, so in short, fast action sequences, characters were hard to see—or rather their impression would be weakened. So I remade it with stronger projection. Result: good balance! Self-praise (laugh).

Shiki's big technique "Lion's Threat Earth Roll" (←is that how it's written?) is all CG. The actual CG footage took a while to come up, making me a bit anxious (laugh), but it had impressive volume! A bit "The Mummy" (laugh).

Then the latter half "Afterglow Color." Visual imagery of that helpless feeling after sunset—from my real experiences tent-packing and mountain climbing in the past, I had this "like this!" feeling inside me. So it became that way. This is also one of my favorite scenes.

Now, what will become of Nami who submitted to Shiki!? And what about Luffy and the others!?

This continues one more time.

# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Embarrassingly Reaching 100 Episodes Somehow, Special Edition: "Back Then I Painted That"

September has arrived. Only four months left this year. Don't you feel like time accelerates once summer passes? ...Wait, just me?

Apparently this "Color Design Notes" is the 100th installment.

How did we get here without me noticing... With Yoshimatsu-san's "1000 episodes" and the editor-in-chief's "200 episodes" - such spectacular numbers dancing around Anime Style lately - my series' "100 episodes" represents 100 episodes of constantly dropping manuscripts, so it's just embarrassing. That they've published the rambling writings of a mere color staff member for 100 episodes - I'm newly grateful to the editorial staff.

Still, apparently some people are reading this series, occasionally getting comments like "I'm reading your series!" which makes me quite sheepish. Particularly some quite young industry colleagues are reading it, making me wonder how these "old stories" feel to such people.

Honestly, there's nothing particularly educational - I'm just trying to record what I've done before my memory becomes unreliable with age. So I hope to continue rambling... sometimes dropping manuscripts (...oops), as long as I'm allowed to write.

Now then.

People started saying "What will you write for the 100th episode?" I wasn't particularly conscious of "100 episodes," but thinking maybe there's something for the occasion... hmm, honestly no timely topics, or stories that are interesting but can't be written due to my position (laughs).

So I'm digging up old stories again. Titled "Back Then I Painted That."

Before I started color direction work at Toei Animation (東映アニメーション, formerly Toei Doga), I did coloring work at a finishing production company in Ikebukuro called Kozue Anime Co., Ltd. I wrote about this long ago. I painted cuts from many different works there. While that production company's main work centered on Toei works, we also received lots of jobs from other production companies, including coloring jobs secretly taken without company knowledge. Today I'll share some stories from those coloring days.

First, the theatrical *Dr. Slump: Arale-chan - Hoyoyo! The Secret Treasure of Nanaba Castle*.

Released in 1984, this was a Toei Doga work. A *Dr. Slump* work for Toei Manga Festival during the series' big hit period. Among several *Arale-chan* movies made then, this was the masterpiece for story, direction, animation, and color. Color direction was by Fujioka Masako-san. I'd later become her colleague, and she did remarkably detailed, excellent work. I was quite envious. This work might have been what triggered my departure from Kozue Anime. Such a work.

I was post-serious illness then, no longer able to do intensive coloring like before, mainly doing finishing management at Kozue Anime. Getting involved in this *Nanaba Castle* finishing, I could feel my body heating up - such a work. So I didn't do much coloring myself, but it's a very important title.

*Earth Story: Telepasii 2500*.

Summer 1984 theatrical release. Recently touched upon in "Anime-sama 365 Days." Ah, what a nostalgic title (laughs).

I remember this being produced with quite a relaxed schedule. So with a long schedule, I took on quite a few cuts.

This was a Tatsunoko (タツノコ) work, yet color direction and paints were STAC. According to what Kozue Anime's president told me then, the finishing person in charge (?) said "STAC has more stable colors and easier retake processing!" and pushed through with STAC for this work. Well, I don't know how much was true, but since it used STAC paints that we were accustomed to, it was very easy for us.

There were *Earth Story* exclusive L-number and T-number paints - quite a range of subdued colors. Especially skin tone variations.

Around then, Sanrio works also used unique exclusive paints (three letters + three numbers like AKB-003!). As a paint-loving person, I was simply delighted facing lots of different numbered paint bottles (laughs).

Inspired by "Anime-sama 365 Days," I actually bought a used video on Amazon and watched the main episode for the first time. ...Ah, so that's what kind of story it was. Somewhat subtle (laughs). But I could feel the "mood" of anime from that era.

*Giant Gorg*.

Broadcast in 1984, but production was well underway by 1983.

I was secretly doing personal part-time coloring for this without company knowledge (burst). How did that happen? I think a "doesn't anyone personally help with coloring?" type request reached me. Sunrise works that Kozue rarely took, plus a robot show. And most importantly, Yasuhiko Yoshikazu's new anime! This I absolutely had to do. So I secretly took it (laughs).

Even so, personal coloring jobs are limited in volume and cuts, but it was incredibly fresh. Content and schedule were tough, but I worked quite hard at it. How I painted "secretly": coming to the studio on days off "secretly," or late nights, all-nighters "secretly" (laughs).

Color direction instructions had human characters mostly shadowless coloring. Only close-ups got shadow coloring. Shadows were properly drawn in the in-betweens. But shadows were ignored for shadowless coloring. Somewhat ambiguous for my "coloring heart" but unavoidable. In return, mechanical elements were solid: normal/shadow 1/shadow 2/BL shadow plus highlights.

Most difficult was coloring Gorg itself. While it didn't have many colors, almost any size got normal/shadow 1/shadow 2/BL shadow plus highlights. And this guy walks. Doesn't run. Many, many sheets of slow walking in-betweens meant high frame counts (laughs). Super finishing-killer.

What impressed me then was the "night color conversion chart." "For night scenes, replace normal-specified paint numbers using this 'conversion chart.'" Converting with this, amazingly everyone became bluish night colors! It was incredibly fresh. Toei works never had such things. ...But this was incredibly troublesome (laughs).

Oh yes, the unit price was incredibly low for the content (laughs).

Then *Miyuki*.

Around 1983. The TV series of that *Miyuki* by Adachi Mitsuru. The ending theme "Omoide ga Ippai" became a hit, making the work famous.

There was Kitty Film Mitaka Studio near Mitakadai Station on the Keio Inokashira Line, handling what I think was their only TV series. I remember Kozue Anime and Suzuki Doga Kikaku (a giant finishing company in Chiba, Ichihara(?)) took on most of this series' finishing. I think we did most finishing except gross production episodes.

I loved this *Miyuki*'s color direction - within limited colors, it was well-assembled in pastels with clothing coordination that made me excited whenever new color direction arrived each episode. Ah, maybe I'm influenced by *Miyuki*'s colors? I feel that way somehow.

Watching the work now, it's quite subtle overall (laughs), but then I really loved it and worked with deep attachment.

Writing this reminds me - among the production managers then was a young, beautiful manager K-san, and I, a secret fan, looked forward nightly to her bringing cuts to the studio. Memories from when I was 20 (laughs).

Later, through *Miyuki* connections, I helped with Kitty Film Mitaka Studio's video work *Karuizawa Syndrome* (original by Tagami Yoshihisa). ...Though just helping with finishing retake processing. I was locked up about two full days at their Mure studio, helping with considerable finishing corrections.

Googling my name "Tsujita Kunio" always brings up this *Karuizawa Syndrome*. Yes, it was unpaid work with the condition of appearing in ending credits (burst).

Was I already at Toei Doga then? (laughs)

These works are all important to me - I actually still have their color direction sheets preserved at my parents' house (laughs). Including experiences, these color direction sheets are all my little treasures.

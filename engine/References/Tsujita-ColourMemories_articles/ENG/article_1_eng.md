# **Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]**

## **Episode 1: What are Color Design and Color Direction?**

**Nice to meet you.** My name is **Tsujita Kunio (辻田邦夫)**. I work in **color design** and **color direction**.

This time, I've been given the opportunity to write various things for **Anime Style**, and I hope you'll take care of me.

Articles and series about people involved in animation tend to focus on direction, scriptwriting, animation, and art backgrounds. The work of **color direction** and **finishing** rarely gets featured. So here, I thought I'd write about finishing and **color design/color direction**... Though I still have no idea which direction this will go (laughs).

Well then.

In my animation work, I do **[finishing]**, mainly **color design** and **color direction**. Color design? Color direction? It's quite hard to understand, isn't it? This time, let me start with a general explanation of this work.

In the animation screen production process, after progressing through **[storyboard]** → **[layout]** → **[key animation]** → **[in-between animation]**, the drawings are passed to **[finishing]**. Here, the completed line drawings are colored and materials are prepared for filming. But when told "paint it!", you can't know what colors to paint those drawings with. That's where the job of **[color direction]** becomes necessary.

**[Color direction]** checks the content of all cuts (key animation and in-between animation) for that story and adds specifications. For example, "this character uses this color model" or "this rock's color is number XX from the color chart" - adding simple, easy-to-understand "specifications" one by one. And for this, you need the basic color models and rules as a foundation. Creating that is what **[color design]** does.

The work of **[color design]** is "creating and deciding the basic colors for characters" and "creating and deciding the color direction for that work." You color the character line drawings drawn by the character designer, but you construct the image through discussions and meetings with the director (direction), character designer, art director, and producers, then translate it into actual colors. When there's an original manga or similar source, you first reference the colors in that original work.

Based on the character colors decided this way, you create the color worldview for that entire work. For this, coordination with **[art]** becomes important. "How dark should night scenes be?" "Is the western sun in evening scenes strong or weak?" - decisions are made while placing them on art boards (background paintings).

Then you meet with **[color direction]** and request actual color instructions. The teamwork between **[color design]** and **[color direction]** is important. While **[color design]** makes judgments about the entire work, **[color direction]** looks at individual actual drawings (key animation and in-between animation).

After having the colors specified this way, **[painting]** paints them, and then **[inspection]** checks whether the painted results are correct. This is roughly the **[finishing]** process. Then those OK cels are passed to **[photography]** for filming.

Well, I've explained it simply, but from next time I'll go into more depth.

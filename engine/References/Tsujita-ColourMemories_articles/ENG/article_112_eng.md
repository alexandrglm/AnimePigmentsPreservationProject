Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

Episode 112: New Year Special Edition - *STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* Notes (Middle Part... Actually Part 1 Part 2)

Yesterday in Tokyo, we had the first snow of winter dancing down. First snow. In Oizumi it started snowing around noon and was coming down nicely for a while, but unfortunately it quickly turned to rain.

In the distant past when I was a student, there was the "Joint First-Stage University Examination" for national and public universities every January 15th (ah, that's what's now called the "Center Test"), and mysteriously it would always snow on that day without fail. January 15th was "Coming of Age Day" anyway. Every year without fail, footage of people heading to exam venues in the snow and footage of 20-year-olds in ceremonial dress walking to coming-of-age ceremonies while minding their kimono hems in the snow would flow from the news—that was the standard.

When was the last time we had "heavy snow"?

Tokyo rarely gets snow in recent years. There are definitely quite a few Tokyo residents thinking "I wish we'd get enough snow to stop the trains once or twice a winter" (laugh). I wonder how it'll be? Will this winter bring that kind of heavy snow to Tokyo?

Now then.

Continuing "*STRONG WORLD ONE PIECE FILM* notes."

I sent the first batch of character color samples to original creator Oda-san and waited several days. The long-awaited response came back. However, it wasn't a particularly favorable response.

There weren't any particular comments about the base colors I'd created—Robin with bright skin and Nami with light hair color seemed "OK"—but the costume colors were apparently lacking somehow. "The excitement doesn't come through"—I believe that was the comment.

The colors I'd conceived and built up had shifted somewhat toward a realistic direction in their coordination, and in addition to aiming too much for the original color illustrations' atmosphere, from the director's word "transparency," I'd made the colors overall too light. That seemed to be the problem. The colors themselves probably lacked a bit of "powerful projection" or "volume." Looking back, there are several things that make me think "Yeah, that's right..."

And then, that unique "Oda World."

Everyone has their own color worldview—especially creators, the original authors of popular manga. The person who created the characters and story naturally has strong visual images in their head. Frustrating as it is, it can't be surpassed. I was the one who couldn't show Oda-san something that would make him "grin."

And then...

"This might be very rude to Tsujita-san, but..." Oda-sensei said, "This time, I'd like to have input on every part I can possibly have input on..."

We ended up having to ask Oda-sensei to do the costume color coordination concepts. Additional work amid his incredibly busy weekly serialization schedule—I was full of apologetic feelings.

After waiting about three more weeks, it arrived from Oda-san—the raw manuscript of color concepts. Character line art arranged in rows, with colors carefully placed using color ink (I think?). Oda-san must have pondered various options too, because on top of the once-colored versions, 2-3 alternative options per character were overlaid and pasted, neatly organized so the first choice was on top.

Facing those color concepts, Director Sakai and I groaned. Wow, it was truly Oda World!

"Well, this is really a color world that only the original creator could produce," Director Sakai and I said. Oda-san's color proposals were bolder than any combination we'd thought of, and they fit the characters perfectly. It was frustratingly good (laugh). These were truly color coordinations and combinations that only the original creator could produce.

Thus character color creation resumed. Based on this first proposal from Oda-san, I repainted the color samples. Golden Lion Shiki and Luffy's group costumes were mostly Oda-san's proposals, but still, for several characters including Golden Lion's subordinates Dr. Indigo and Captain Scarlett, Oda-san had colored them exactly as I'd proposed. So these remained basically as-is.

I lined up the newly painted characters on the monitor again and adjusted the color volume balance between characters. Once everything was roughly in order, after director approval, I sent them back to Oda-san for checking again.

However, at this point, we were right up against the "preview trailer" production deadline... The character designs themselves weren't changing, so animation work could proceed, but without finalized colors, color direction (色指定) couldn't be done. Without colors, naturally the trailer couldn't be made. But the deadline was also tight. This was something that absolutely couldn't be helped. We couldn't wait for Oda-san's OK before applying colors...

But even for a trailer, fans are waiting to see it, and this would be their first moving visual, so we absolutely couldn't put out something half-hearted. "While movement and poses are important in footage, first impressions are overwhelmingly determined by 'color'"—this is one of my theories, but color's impact on impressions is very significant.

So we proceeded with trailer production and work while waiting for Oda-san's response. I created trailer color direction based on the colors I'd sent to Oda-san for checking and proceeded with cut-by-cut color direction. We'd push the work forward anyway, and if Oda-san gave his OK, we'd continue as-is. If retakes or changes came back, we'd respond to make the deadline somehow—that was the strategy.

Eventually, painted trailer cuts came back to me one after another. Naturally all cuts selected from the main feature storyboard. Since they'd basically be used in the main feature as is, the animation volume and impact looked good. These could be projected on screen with confidence.

And finally, Oda-san's response arrived. An "OK"!

Thus that trailer was completed. "Ah, finally we can stand at the starting point for *STRONG WORLD*"—that was my feeling.

# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 101: Autumn New Program Introduction! Special Edition - Please Support *Ghost Stories Restaurant*!

Last Sunday I returned to my parents' house in Sayama City and did quite a bit of searching through my room's storage. And wow, various things came out.

First, cel artwork. Lots of *Dragon Ball Z*, *Fist of the North Star*, *Saint Seiya* and other cel artwork I got from staff during my Toei days. Particularly *Saint Seiya* - cel artwork from the theatrical *The Heated Battle of the Gods* appeared. Including Midgard cel artwork. All with backgrounds of course.

These are quite precious. ...Well, all the others are precious too (sweat). These *Heated Battle of the Gods* cels are ones I quite liked and got as mementos.

Oh yes, the TV series *Miyuki* I spoke passionately about last time - miraculously one cel from this also appeared. Ah, I had this! I was surprised (laughs).

Various works' color direction sheets also appeared. Starting with TV series *Miyuki*, then *Twin Hawks*, *Genma Wars*, *Space Battleship Yamato Final*, *Dairugger XV* and others. Plus *Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer*.

This *Beautiful Dreamer* had "Remember Dream" on the color direction cover, making me remember "ah right, the title changed when it was released."

Just digging a bit yielded quite good results (laughs). Still, *Earth Story* and *Giant Gorg* color direction sheets didn't appear, so they're probably buried somewhere else in other shelves. So I'm thinking of returning for more "excavation" soon.

Now then.

For the 101st installment, let's go with a new development! ...Actually, let me take another beat here. Yes, a bit of promotion for programs I'm participating in (laughs).

The notable new TV anime from Toei Animation this fall would be *Mononoke* director Nakamura Kenji's work *Kuchu Buranko*, but somewhat hidden behind that (laughs), another TV series begins. *Ghost Stories Restaurant* (怪談レストラン) airing on TV Asahi network from October.

The original is the children's literature book series of the same name *Ghost Stories Restaurant* (supervising editor: Matsutani Miyoko / illustrations: Takai Kazuyoshi, Kato Kumiko). An omnibus ghost story series for elementary and middle school students collecting Japanese folk tales, legends, and world ghost stories - this series has an amazing 50 volumes of popular novels.

Now Toei Animation is adapting this into anime. Series director Ikeda Yoko and series composer Yonemura Shoji - the *Negibouzu no Asataro* team. Character design by Studio Dub's Takahashi Akira, art design by Watanabe Yoshito. I'm handling main character color design and main visual coordination. Following the *Hataraki Kids Maiham-gumi* pattern. The effective color design called "color direction" is handled by Toyonaga-san. Other staff also have basically the entire *Negibouzu* crew handling it.

The story develops in omnibus format centered on three elementary students: Ako, Sho, and Reiko. Each week in restaurant format, we deliver three stories: "appetizer," "main course," and "dessert."

*Ghost Stories Restaurant* has 24-station nationwide network, and moreover, every Tuesday night at 7:30 PM - a so-called "golden time" slot!

Recently we properly did "purification" prayers for the program's hit and, since it has "ghost stories" in the title, staff safety. Now we're all set, except for the schedule... (laughs).

So please favor *Ghost Stories Restaurant* among this fall's anime.

## Episode 94: Once Upon a Time... (57) - *COO* How to Make Color Direction Sheets Part 2

This year Tokyo also seems to be having a "dry rainy season." Every morning, weather forecasts often predict "it's going to rain! it's going to rain!" but in reality it's often just "sprinkling" and "drizzling" before stopping.

It's "probability of precipitation."

For example, let's say the probability of precipitation for a certain time period on a certain day is 70%. When we hear 70%, our instinct is to interpret it as:

"A tremendous amount of rain will fall"

But actually, this number means:

"The probability that rain will fall in such weather conditions is 7 out of 10"

It's only about the probability of "whether it will rain or not." Whether it's a heavy downpour or just sprinkling, rain is rain. If rain falls at all, "the forecast was correct!"

Don't you think that's kind of unfair? What do you think? (laughs)

Now then.

Continuing how to make color direction sheets.

As I wrote last time, the base for color direction sheet settings was organized by cutting and pasting from animation setting sheets. We write paint numbers on this.

There are long-established "conventions for writing paint numbers" in the industry. Whether this was started by whoever made Japan's first color direction sheet, or came from overseas - I haven't researched it so I don't know the true origin, but the rule for expressing paint numbers in color direction sheets is "darker goes below."

Long ago, when I was working at a finishing production company, I was teaching a newcomer how to read color direction. After hearing my explanation, they said "Ah, so shadows become the 'denominator'?" which made me think "Oh, I see, exactly." It's just like fraction notation. The denominator is darker than the numerator.

Where and how to write numbers on color direction sheets:

First, draw lines from the parts you want to color direct to empty space outside the artwork. At the end of those lines, add paint number instructions. Write the "normal color" number, draw a line below it, and write the "shadow color" number below the line. If there's a "second shadow" (shadow of the "shadow color," also called "two-level shadow"), draw another line below the "shadow color" and write the number. Incidentally, "highlight colors" are written diagonally above the "normal color" number with symbols like [Hi.].

Not just Toei Animation (東映動画) works, but other companies' works also generally used the same notation. This is actually important.

Finishing work often involves multiple finishing production companies working in parallel like a human wave, and finishing production companies themselves often handle multiple production companies' works simultaneously. For example, one finishing production company might be simultaneously working on Company A's Work A and Company B's Work B. If color direction sheets are made with unique notation methods for each work, workers can get confused. The result: silly mistakes occur → redo work.

To prevent this, notation specifications should follow the same rules. Many people in charge of color direction and color design were finishing company alumni (I was too), having experienced such struggles and problems firsthand. So they naturally converged toward "industry standard" color direction notation. Easy-to-read, mistake-resistant direction sheets became one theme.

These rules remain basically the same even with today's digital coloring.

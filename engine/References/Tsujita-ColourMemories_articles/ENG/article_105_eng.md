## Episode 105: Escaping from the Pirates!!

Lately I've been eating "Cup Noodle" for late-night meals. Actually I don't really like cup noodles and rarely eat them unless it's really necessary, but "Cup Noodle" is different. I've been with it for 30 years now. Since middle school, late-night snacks meant "Cup Noodle." Still taking care of me now.

Particularly the standard "soy sauce" and "curry" are divine! I had curry last night too.

I suddenly remembered a boom way of eating from middle and high school: "dropping in a raw egg."

First, open the lid halfway and pour hot water slightly less, just covering the noodles. Drop one raw egg on top - plop! Then cover and steam. Instead of the usual 3 minutes, about 4 minutes. Then you have perfectly steamed "egg-topped Cup Noodle." This is exquisite not only with "soy sauce" but also "curry."

Ah, I haven't eaten it that way recently.

Does anyone else enjoy "Cup Noodle" like this? (laughs)

Now then.

As I wrote two weeks ago, I'm still "captured by pirates." Struggling to escape. Almost there.

In such "pirate movie" - theatrical *ONE PIECE FILM STRONG WORLD* - a fellow captive is assistant director K-san.

This time there's a character (the enemy boss) called "Golden Lion Pirate Shiki." K-san is assistant director so she often writes character names on cut bags and retake instruction sheets, but her writing of "Shiki" (シキ) always looks like "Tsuki" (ツキ) (laughs).

It's her handwriting habit. "Shi" (シ) and "Tsu" (ツ) - a common story, but as the crunch progresses, fatigue shows even in this young woman, and her handwriting reflects that exhaustion. "Shiki" that was "Tsuki" became even more disheveled and finally became "Shi-kan (sweat)" (laughs).

Fighting such battles, the theatrical *ONE PIECE FILM STRONG WORLD* we're working hard on opens next month, December 12th. Please look forward to it!

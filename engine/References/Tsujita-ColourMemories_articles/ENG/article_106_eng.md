Episode 106: Somehow Escaped from the "Pirate Movie"!!

Last week, I went to Kyoto for a bit. I walked endlessly along the Kamogawa riverbank, going upstream from Shijo all the way to Shimogamo Shrine. It was still a little too early for the autumn leaves, but I thoroughly enjoyed weekday Kyoto and the Kamogawa River. More than anything, it was just the right kind of stimulation for my heart and body, which were completely exhausted from the "pirate movie," and made for a good change of pace.

Kyoto is really close, though.

It's only a little over two hours from Tokyo Station on the Nozomi! You leave Tokyo Station after 10 AM and arrive by noon—that's how close it is. You crack open a beer, feel good, doze off a bit, and before you know it, you're in Kyoto (laugh).

Come to think of it, the very first time I went to Kyoto was on a middle school field trip. I don't remember where we went or what we did anymore (oh wait, I do remember Nijo Castle and Kiyomizu Temple), but it was my first big trip, and I remember having this desperate feeling like I was heading out to some incredibly distant frontier.

Thirty years have passed since then. I often think I'd like to take my time and visit each of those various places I went to back then, one by one.

Unrelated to that, I'll probably be going to Kyoto again around next week (laugh). Oh, this time it's for location scouting.

Now then.

The "pirate movie"—*Strong World ONE PIECE FILM*—which had me trapped for so long, was finally completed last Wednesday. Preview screenings have already been held in various locations nationwide, and there are less than three weeks left until the nationwide release.

Today we finally have our staff preview screening. It's being held in the screening room at the Oizumi projection studio. Normally you'd hold the staff preview before the other screenings start, but well, sometimes these things happen (laugh).

And after the preview, naturally there's the celebration banquet. Actually, we've already had several small parties here and there, but the banquet after the staff preview is something different. It's the last banquet where all the people who worked on this film will gather together for this project.

So I'll probably get dragged away and end up drowning somewhere in Oizumi until morning.

So sorry! That's all for today again! I'll properly get back into the swing of things starting next week. Once the movie is released, I'd like to write about the "pirate movie" again.

And so, *Strong World ONE PIECE FILM* opens nationwide on December 12th. Please look forward to it!

# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 90: Golden Week Extra Edition - *Tomorrow's Nadja* Memory City and That Person's City from *Doremi* (laughs)

Golden Week is over. Once it ended, it immediately got hot (tears). The humidity especially...

During Golden Week, I was away from Japan. While I was away, various things happened. A certain famous rock singer passed away, a certain famous actor got married...

Various things happened among my acquaintances too. A certain color direction person who got married in a lightning engagement (laughs). Or my Seoul friend's mother who passed away suddenly at a young age. Happy and sad events crowded together during this year's Golden Week.

Now then.

This year's Golden Week, I took a somewhat long break and traveled around northern Italy. From Milan to Parma, Bologna, Venice, Verona, and back to Milan. I saw various things in each city and ate lots (laughs).

Whether domestic or international, whenever I travel anywhere, I'm always curious about places related to works I've been involved with that appeared in the main episodes. And speaking of Europe, there's *Tomorrow's Nadja* (明日のナージャ).

In *Tomorrow's Nadja*, we "traveled" across Europe from England to Austria for about a year. Italy also appeared - Milan, Venice, and Rome - but the place I love most that appeared across 2 full episodes (episodes 18-19) was Venice.

Actually, this was my third visit to Venice! My previous visit was 11 years ago. So this was my first time since *Nadja*. In the main episodes, famous places like canals, St. Mark's Square, and Rialto Bridge appeared, but naturally they were all major spots I'd been to before. So during main episode work at the time, I knew the atmosphere of every place perfectly and could create perfect colors and ambiance.

However, one place I'd never been to appeared in the main episodes: the Contarini del Bovolo Palace and its spiral staircase. I should have seen most major points, but I'd never been there at all. When I looked it up, it was properly listed in guidebooks, but probably honestly not with very good photos, so I'd unconsciously passed by that building.

Episode 19. Carnival night. In the scene chasing the "Black Rose" fleeing from St. Mark's Square, that place appeared just briefly, just a few cuts. The "Black Rose" performing against the full moon on rooftops - Nadja and Harvey watch that scene from this spiral staircase.

The art board Yuki Yukie-san drew for that scene. The palace appearing in the night scene looked white, beautiful, and fantastic in Venice's deep blue night, with the spiral staircase also floating up white and soft.

This time, I absolutely wanted to see that palace, that spiral staircase, so I went to visit it.

That day in Venice was refreshing weather with occasional showers, but it was pleasant, truly perfect sightseeing weather in Venice style.

From morning I toured various churches, immersing myself in religious paintings. When the sun tilted a bit, I finally aimed for the "spiral staircase" and walked endlessly through alleyways. Walking through the maze-like city's winding paths, I finally reached my destination.

"Ah, here it is!"

The palace stood quietly, as if protected within Venice's labyrinth.

But unfortunately, this building was already a "dead" building.

Venice is the "city that stopped time." Buildings that have existed there for centuries have their interiors renovated to suit modern life while maintaining their external appearance, using them as they are. So even if they look like old buildings from the past, most are "living" buildings.

However, this palace was a "dead" building. It was already ruins with no one living there, and even repairs to broken parts weren't being done. Naturally, tourists like us were prohibited from entering. We could only look from afar, from our side of the iron fence.

"Ah, I see..." I sighed.

Until seeing the real thing here, I had assumed it was still a "living" building.

"Ah, maybe when Nadja ran up these stairs, maybe it was already dead? No, that couldn't be, surely"

Looking up at the spiral staircase, I was alone in my sentimentality (laughs). While I shouldn't mix up anime and reality, I momentarily immersed myself in an imaginary world around 1900 from the story.

The palace and stairs surrounded by cold iron fencing stood there quietly yet beautifully in the slightly darkening evening shadows. Needless to say, Yukie-san's art board images seemed to softly overlay on top (laughs).

By the way, the next day I went to Murano Island. The island famous as the birthplace of Venetian glass. I went to that island to search for Mirai-san and her workshop (!), but unfortunately I couldn't find them (laughs).

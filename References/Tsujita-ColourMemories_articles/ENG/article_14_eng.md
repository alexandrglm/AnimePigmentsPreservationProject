## **Episode 14: GW Memorial... Japanese Anime Protagonists Speaking Foreign Languages**

**Golden Week (GW) - how did everyone spend it?**

**In the end, I spent half my GW working.** Well, this is fine too (bitter laugh). The only place I went out was the National Art Center in Nogizaka. I went to see the "Monet Exhibition," but faced with the massive crowds and long lines at the ticket booth, I gave up on the "Monet Exhibition" 6 seconds after arrival. I just got swept along by the human wave and drifted through the equally crowded Tokyo Midtown.

**Maybe because of that fatigue (← wrong), I completely mixed up the day of the week and totally missed yesterday's update deadline! (cries)** So sorry (sweat).

Well then.

**I think many people spent GW overseas, but did any of you watch anime during your travels?** Japanese-made anime, specifically.

**I once watched extensively from early morning in Rome, Italy.** That day happened to be Saturday, and early morning seemed to be that kind of time slot. The works shown that day were *Future Boy Conan*, *Haikara-san ga Tōru (はいからさんが通る)*, *Lupin III*, and *Maison Ikkoku*. There were also 2-3 other older Japanese robot shows and classics on different channels, but I've forgotten the titles.

**Japanese anime characters speaking Italian from a cheap Rome hotel TV!** Somehow strange (laughs). Still, with *Lupin* and *Conan*, there was no sense of incongruity. Especially *Lupin* almost seemed to fit. *Conan* was around Episode 3, I think? By this point, I had most of the dialogue memorized, so it was probably being converted in my brain naturally.

**But *Haikara-san ga Tōru* and *Maison Ikkoku*...** Content-wise, they're universal topics in a sense, so if Italians watched properly they'd naturally empathize, but the *Maison Ikkoku* episode that day had the Tohoku (?) Shinkansen stopped due to an accident or something, and the Ikkoku-kan residents started having a drinking party on the station platform... something like that (probably). **Ichinose-san with a sake bottle arguing with station staff in Italian**... hmm, surreal (laughs).

**Though Italy is also a major railway country, and above all a cheerful country, so maybe such situations really exist there (bitter laugh).**

**Not anime, but I also watched old Japanese movies on TV.** None other than "**Matango**." In Florence on Sunday at 10 AM! (laughs) I was just stunned. They were speaking proper Italian. Why "Matango" at such a time on Sunday? Too mysterious - my head was spinning (bitter laugh).

**Not just Italy - in Switzerland, Germany, Greece, and Southeast Asian countries, I've repeatedly encountered Japanese anime being broadcast during travels.** Japanese anime protagonists speaking each country's language. Unfortunately, I never got to watch works I was involved in, but it's purely happy that anime from our country, anime we know well, is being watched by so many people and children in various countries.

**Oh yes, about 10 years ago now, when I first went to New York.** I spent all night in the hotel watching cable TV anime channels. Japanese-made anime there were just scattered here and there. Most were American-made anime. However, one show surprised and made me very happy.

**That work was *Muppet Babies*.** One of the "collaborative works" once produced at Toei Doga. And amazingly, the episode airing on TV was one I had done color direction for! Man, I was moved! I never expected to reunite here! I was so happy I watched intently (laughs).

**Something I was somewhat involved in remains like this, properly broadcasts somewhere in the world, and various people watch it.** It's really happy. That's why I can't quit this job (laughs).

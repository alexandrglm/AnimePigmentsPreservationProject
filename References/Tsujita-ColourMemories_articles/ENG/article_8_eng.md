## **Episode 8: Once Upon a Time... (6) Cel Paints Have a Sweet Fragrance That's Wonderful**

**The other day I went to see the movie "Bubble he GO!! Time Machine wa Drum-shiki."** A story about time-traveling from 2007 to the bubble peak year 1990 to prevent the bubble's collapse and save Japan's near-bankrupt economy. **Hirosue Ryoko** love! **Abe Hiroshi** the best! It was quite an enjoyable movie and I was very satisfied.

**Come to think of it, the stories I've been writing about from around 1985 are exactly bubble period stories.** But personally, I don't really remember receiving any particular bubble benefits (bitter laugh).

Well then.

**This week I'll return to the main story.** About paints.

**When I started finishing work at that Ikebukuro production company, since the finishing production I belonged to mainly took Toei work, the paints used there were naturally mostly **Stack** (STAC: I think it was Saito Tele Animation Color) paints.** But occasionally, we'd take rush jobs from production companies other than Toei Doga, and most of those jobs used different paints from Toei's. **Taiyo Shikisai (太陽色彩)** paints.

**Before entering the industry, I never imagined there were two paint manufacturers** (actually there were many more companies making cel paints, but I learned this much later). Moreover, the colors and numbering were different with subtle incompatibility. But thinking about it, the anime programs I watched on TV back then - Toei works and works from other companies clearly had different screen brilliance and color atmospheres, which I'd noticed even as an amateur. One major factor was the paint issue itself.

**As I wrote about *Yamato* last time, Stack colors with overall vivid tones versus Taiyo Shikisai paints with matte tones.** Stack colors that could appear transparent when painted thin versus Taiyo colors that were uniform in any color and dried quickly. Stack colors with high transparency but prone to spoiling with rotten egg-like odors versus Taiyo colors that would quickly harden if you weren't careful. Stack colors that sometimes had fluffy white mold growing on the surface when you opened them versus Taiyo colors that could cause white clouding in finished painting if not well stirred.

**As color design or color direction, which I preferred depends entirely on the case.** When wanting vivid colors, Stack colors were good, and for subdued intermediate tones, definitely Taiyo Shikisai. Most of all, Taiyo colors had many colors and were easy to create gradations, but the numbering system was complex, often leading to specification and painting mistakes... (bitter laugh).

**But for us doing finishing painting work on site, more than paint color development, it was first about ease of painting and drying speed.** Paint spread and brush movement favored Stack colors, while drying speed favored Taiyo Shikisai. Ah, color trace work ease was definitely Stack colors. Especially Stack's "**Trace Black**" used for line corrections had very fine, smooth material quality and was the best paint for hand tracing.

**(I think Taiyo Shikisai also had "Trace Black," but trace lines drawn with these paints had an enamel-like glossy reflection, and unfortunately they stuck easily to the protective "tissue paper" on cels and animation paper, making them hard to use back then...)**

**And the individual "quirks" of paints themselves were problematic.** You had to know each paint's individual "quirks," or when you dried and collected the carefully painted cels and flipped them over, you'd end up going "Aggh!"

**Following dim memories, Stack paint large bottles, called "kilo bottles," cost about 1,600 yen each back then,** PB series (vivid pink colors) were slightly more expensive, and "Trace Black" was nearly 2,000 yen. I've forgotten the unit cost of raw cels. Incidentally, carbon for machine tracing was each subcontracting production company's burden. I think black carbon was about 20 yen per sheet. Brown and other colored carbons were about 25 yen.

**When I started work at the finishing production company, all materials for Toei works were supplied by Toei.** Raw cels, paints - everything was provided by Toei. Finishing subcontractors only handled finishing work. For paints, when you ran out, you'd tell the finishing progress staff the color number and they'd prepare it in advance so you could take it back with cuts (back then, shelves for each production company were set up in the finishing department for cut exchanges).

**However, that "material supply" was suddenly discontinued one month, and while there was some upcharge to finishing unit costs as "material costs," everything else became each finishing production's burden.** It was effectively a unit cost reduction. This was a big blow to finishing subcontractors back then. Well, other companies' works normally used this system. My production company and similar companies that mainly did Toei works increased the weight of non-Toei works from that point. This coincided with when animation production volume was starting to increase.

**Even when Taiyo Shikisai paint jobs came in, they weren't constantly high volume, so naturally we couldn't afford to stock a complete set of Taiyo Shikisai paints.** So what did we do? We used "conversion charts" to convert Taiyo color specifications to Stack colors for painting.

**"Conversion charts"!** Every finishing production company used them back then. Sometimes each finishing production made and used their own, sometimes production companies brought them.

**As I wrote earlier, Taiyo colors and Stack colors have basically no compatibility.** Even gray paints have subtly different colors. So we very forcibly and roughly "converted" them for painting (laughs). It's unthinkable now, but back then it was OK even if colors were somewhat different.

**For absolutely unavailable colors, we'd ask production progress staff to bring the necessary number of small bottles along with cuts.** The Taiyo paints brought this way gradually increased as inventory. So when taking rush jobs, we'd start by rewriting color specifications with our Taiyo paint inventory list in hand and calling to identify missing colors.

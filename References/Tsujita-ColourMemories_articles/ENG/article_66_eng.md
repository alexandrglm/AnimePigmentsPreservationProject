# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 66: Once Upon a Time... (43) - Racing Through the Studio at 5 AM! Theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors*

There are no bananas.

Apparently some variety show said they're good for dieting, and due to that influence, everyone and their dog is going "bananas, bananas," causing banana shortages throughout Japan. Geez, what unnecessary trouble!

I've been eating bananas regularly for a long time, regardless of dieting. They're just right for meals when busy. Good digestion too.

But now, during this incredibly busy period, they're not sold anywhere. It's very inconvenient.

Let me be clear: eating a few bananas won't make you lose weight! I'm saying this as someone who always eats them, so I'm not wrong. Before going "bananas for dieting," people should fundamentally review their daily eating habits!

Ah, bananas (sobbing)!

Well then.

Theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors*. Editing and dubbing were somehow finished, and while keeping an eye on sound mixing deadlines, the days continued with color direction & coloring completion inspections.

For about two and a half weeks from editing/dubbing to final mixing, the cycle continued: cel inspection of completed coloring cuts during the day, color direction on key animation at night. At that time, when key animation was sent out with color direction, it usually came back as finished cels after about one week of animation + finishing work.

I think Manila studios took a bit longer. Moreover, around that time the Philippines was politically unstable, with volcanic eruptions too, so jobs without much schedule leeway were somewhat precarious...

So partly due to such circumstances, the final push mainly involved asking Korean productions for help. Taiyo Shikisai cuts kept increasing.

The final cut's color direction was at 5 AM.

That day there was a hand-carry flight from Toei Doga's Oizumi Studio to Korea. Departure was 5 AM. Right up to that deadline, animation supervisor Maeda-san added corrections to key animation. Several cuts remained that day. Each time a correction was finished, the production coordinator brought it to me (in a slightly separate room), I'd add color direction, then the finishing coordinator would take it for packing - an assembly line process.

However, since these were cuts that remained until the end, they were considerably difficult in various ways, with heavy animation content and correction work. I believe that day's flight was taken by a department head from a Korean production company returning to Korea. The person was already prepared and waiting for departure time, but even as departure time approached, the cargo to be transported wasn't ready. We somehow managed to placate the person wanting to leave early, having them wait with their bag open.

The very final cut - the production coordinator brought it to me in a great rush right at 5 AM. With today's digital coloring, you can manage somehow even if color direction is rough or "free coloring," but with paint coloring, you must add proper color direction before sending it out. I quickly checked the key animation and added color direction, then ran through the studio with that cut and stuffed it into the waiting cargo...

What a morning past 5 AM that was. A strange sense of fulfillment that could become addictive (bitter laugh). The sleepiness had completely lifted in that still-dark, cold February morning.

This completed the color direction work. Now the battle with massive cel completions would begin.

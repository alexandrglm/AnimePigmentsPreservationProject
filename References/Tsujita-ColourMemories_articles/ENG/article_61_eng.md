## Episode 61: Summer Vacation Special - Saint Seiya: Hades Inferno Chapter & Elysion Chapter Completion & Broadcast Memorial Complete Episode Notes (Final Part)

Summer means ghost stories and scary tales, doesn't it? (laugh)

In high school, I was in the astronomy club, and during summer camps or at nighttime observation sites, upperclassmen would start telling scary stories (laugh). In the fog, sitting in a circle on the ground with a candle flame from a lantern in the middle (laugh). We enjoyed doing such things.

My alma mater was Tokyo Metropolitan Fuji High School, and Fuji High had something called the "Seven Mysteries of Fuji High," passed down orally from upperclassmen to underclassmen through generations. "The story of feet being pulled at the pool in the evening," "The photo club darkroom used to be an X-ray room..." story, "The story of the toilet next to the duck pen," "The story of the warped mirror in front of the library," and so on (laugh).

I wonder how those "Seven Mysteries" are doing now? Are they still being passed down through generations? Since the old school buildings related to the "Seven Mysteries" were rebuilt, maybe the traditions have been lost?

I remember this every year around the time when Perseid meteor shower season approaches.

Well then.

Finally the final installment of "Saint Seiya: Hades Inferno Chapter & Elysion Chapter Completion & Broadcast Memorial Complete Episode Notes." At last, the final chapter "Hades Elysion Chapter."

**Elysion Chapter Episode 1 - Death Battle to Elysion - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

For Elysion Chapter, I asked Akimoto-san, who loves "Ikki-niisan!" to handle color direction from episode 1. No, I was planning to handle episode 1 as usual, but due to a production communication error, Akimoto-san was called to the episode 1 meeting (bitter laugh). So I said "Then, do it!" (laugh). Thus, Akimoto-san handled color direction for all episodes.

Episode 1 was still the story of passing through "The Wailing Wall." So almost exactly the same color design created for "Inferno Chapter: Finale" could be reused.

**Elysion Chapter Episode 2 - Gods of Death and Sleep - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

From episode 2, the stage finally moved to Elysion. Elysion Chapter became a bright world overflowing with light, in contrast to Inferno Chapter. Actually, this was quite difficult.

In *Saint Seiya*'s case, they're constantly fighting, but rather than hand-to-hand combat martial arts, it had become mainly projectile-style fighting where they shoot light at each other. Such screen effects naturally look better in dark spaces.

At the episode 1 meeting, I proposed "Let's make battles image spaces whenever possible." In image spaces we could create dark spaces, and light photography processing would work better. That was my aim with the proposal.

From episode 2, Thanatos and Hypnos finally appeared.

Actually, these two had been appearing in the opening since *Inferno Chapter: Prelude* along with Hades in Surplice. Since we couldn't show them "until they appeared in the main story," they were silhouette processed throughout *Inferno Chapter* and even in *Elysion Chapter* until episode 2, but when we first made the opening for *Inferno Chapter: Prelude*, these two's colors were almost complete.

I absolutely love these two. They're my personal best among all the Cloths and Surplices we've done so far.

Incidentally, the opening had been steadily accumulating small fixes through *Prelude*, *Finale*, and *Elysion Chapter* (laugh). While openings tend to get skipped in DVDs (laugh), it might be interesting to watch them all in sequence for comparison (laugh).

**Elysion Chapter Episode 3 - Golden Reinforcements - Direction/Nishizawa Nobutaka**

Regarding Seiya's sister "Seika," we hadn't had proper character sheets until now, and while she appeared briefly in *Inferno Chapter*, we roughly decided colors based on the key animation that came up then. This time too, no character sheets came out in the end (bitter laugh), so we created coloring settings from key animation used in the main story.

Speaking of missing settings, I actually forgot that we hadn't created digital coloring color direction for Bear Geki and others (sweat), so I had Akimoto-san handle all of that through screen matching too.

For the Sanctuary where Seika and others are, character colors gradually darken in stages according to the eclipse's progress.

**Elysion Chapter Episode 4 - Legendary God Cloths - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

Finally they appeared - the God Cloths (ゴッドクロス).

These are anime original colorings. In the original color settings, all five were the same gold color, but that overlapped too much with Gold Saints. Actually, from the end of episode 3, Seiya and others are wearing Gold Cloths, so even changing them a bit would still be hard to differentiate on screen.

And I wanted to bring out each of the five's individual "colors" from the Cloths they'd fought in until then. The God Cloths' basic whitish color is common to all five, with their respective "colors" applied to the shadow colors.

These colored God Cloths had already appeared in *Saint Seiya: Heaven Chapter Overture* (director Yamauchi Shigeyasu). In mythological times, the Saint who uniquely wounded Hades wore these God Cloths. See? It connects properly, right? (laugh)

All underwear is white too. For the God Cloths' color balance and to express the sacred, elevated feeling of "God Cloths," I made everyone white.

In episode 4, Seiya first dons the God Cloth, and photography director Ogata-san worked hard on that donning scene. To somehow give form to my request for "aura rising from the God Cloth itself," he repeated test photography many times and even did voluntary retakes himself.

**Elysion Chapter Episode 5 - Hades! Awakening from Myth - Direction/Nishizawa Nobutaka**

Even *Elysion Chapter*, which should have had sufficient schedule, still had quite tight scheduling for episode 5 and the final episode. Well, this is anime production's fate (bitter laugh).

Hades' soul rising from the mausoleum was also special effects team technique. Without using 3D, they manually created translucent effects based on normally drawn materials. Photography then added aura light on top.

Not just "Hades' soul" but also the "great jar" - everything was given texture brush processing by the special effects team. Naturally, the scattering rubble, Elysion garden flowers, Seiya and others' battle effects, and so on. The special effects team's hands touched absolutely everything. For *Saint Seiya*, the special effects team's power was indispensable.

As tension rises toward the end, work volume and content inevitably become extraordinary. Moreover, available time keeps decreasing. But they persevered and completed everything to the end.

"Let's add texture brushing to all cuts and all characters!" When entering *Inferno Chapter: Finale*, I proposed this and pushed it through - there might have been some resistance (laugh) - but huge thanks to Katsuoka-kun and the special effects team who worked hard together to complete it!

**Elysion Chapter Episode 6 - To a World Overflowing with Light! - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

The final Cloth I decided on was "Athena's Cloth."

I thought Seiya and others' God Cloths and "Athena's Cloth" should have common elements, so I based it on the gold coloring used for God Cloths, arranging whitish colors also used for God Cloths in the Cloth edge paint divisions. This "Athena's Cloth" was also a dazzling golden Cloth in the original color settings. I was able to arrange this well with coloring close to the original.

"Thanatos," "Hypnos," "God Cloths," and "Athena's Cloth." All the Surplices and Cloths appearing in Elysion Chapter are my absolute favorites (laugh).

***

*Hades Elysion Chapter* ended after a year and a half from production start, and the long-running *Saint Seiya* anime adaptation concluded with this. The "Saint Seiya team" was disbanded.

Having defeated Hades and saved the earth's crisis, where will Athena and the Saints go next? What about Athena? What about the fallen Seiya? Ah, I want to make this continuation!

"I don't know when it will be..." After the final episode staff first screening ended, producer Obara-kun said in his greeting. "I want to do it again! *Saint Seiya*!" I want to wait for that day.

## **Episode 20: Once Upon a Time... (15) *Saint Seiya* Part 2 - Episode 1, and OP & ED Stories**

**Last Saturday night, I got an email on my cell phone from a female acquaintance (25, single). From Narita Airport no less!** "I thought the excitement before my first overseas trip departure could only be conveyed now, so I'm emailing." Ah, that's right. That day was her very first overseas trip ever.

**The feeling when you've passed immigration and are waiting at the departure gate looking at your plane through the window - that indescribable strange heart flutter of anxiety and anticipation.** And it's her first time! Reading that email, this old man found himself getting gentle eyes (laughs).

**Then Sunday late night, Tokyo region broadcast the latest *Suiyou Dou Deshou Ka* (Wednesday How About It).** I was watching while working at the studio, and ah, it's Europe! Rome, Vatican, Florence! Ah, I want to go after so long!

**The new passport I picked up recently has no scheduled use yet.** Actually, I took a week off early this month. I wanted to go to Brussels and Antwerp. But I ended up just relaxing in Tokyo (bitter laugh).

**I want to go out somewhere by maybe next month...** Ah, maybe impossible. Then, then at least in autumn... (distant stare).

Well then.

***Saint Seiya* Episode 1. Script: **Koyama Takao**, Storyboard & Direction: **Morishita Kozo**, Animation Director: **Araki Shingo**, Art Director: **Kubota Tadao**.**

**Toei Doga's TV series finishing system at this time assigned one "inspection" member as the person in charge of each work, but usually they only handled program startup and later-appearing "main treatment" character coloring settings (so-called "color direction sheets"), with per-episode color direction requested from production companies handling that episode's finishing.**

**As I wrote earlier, basically character color direction was also handled by art, so guest character colors appearing in each episode were all specified by art director **Kubota-san**, with per-episode finishing production companies communicating with art through art department progress to decide.**

**For example, guest characters appearing in #3 who then appear in several subsequent episodes would get OK from the first episode's direction, then that OK color direction would be passed to the next episode's production company, and so on.** Usually colors from art were OK as-is, so art's specifications - copies with paint numbers noted on character design drawings - would circulate as-is as color direction sheets.

**As an aside, due to such systems, most early *Saint Seiya* episode guest characters lack properly organized color direction sheets.** Toei Doga didn't place "setting production" then or now (assistant directors managed it), so color direction got quite scattered.

**Also, because of such color direction sheets, there were many coloring mistakes.** Unlike now where color designers check all episodes, things other than properly organized main characters were OK if consistent within that episode and production company.

**However, Episode 1 and opening/ending were handled by internal inspection, so Episode 1 was basic - the series standard.** But Episode 1 is the very first, so following direction instructions for color direction was all I could do. I had no capacity to think about later episodes back then (bitter laugh). Just adding color direction to in-between animation coming to me one after another.

**Also back then, we weren't allowed to check TV series finishing deliveries.** Delivered cels went directly from finishing progress to **saridashi** (compositing), with assistant directors checking before **saridashi** if time allowed. So color mistakes and such would only become retakes after being photographed and becoming rush film, or when lined up and connected during editing (well, this system basically hasn't changed even now (bitter laugh)). We often weren't even invited to rushes.

**So, Episode 1.**

**Actually, before writing this, I secretly rewatched Episode 1 on DVD.** Ah, I don't remember much detail about this Episode 1 main story, actually (bitter laugh). Since I was completely unaccustomed to "image-style screen direction," I just remember constantly taking cuts to ask **Morishita-san** about everything.

**For example, "**Shaina-san**'s '**Thunder Claw**' cobra image scene" and such.** Image backgrounds with this animation - what kind of screen would it be as cel, how would it look with transmitted light added in photography? I couldn't really imagine it, so I remember just groping through specifications.

**Rewatching reminded me that pupil highlight processing wasn't finalized yet.** Also **Pegasus** **Saint Cloth (聖衣)** highlight processing. How to process highlights on white, like **Marin**'s mask highlights - trial and error (laughs).

**I remember opening and ending work better than Episode 1 main story.** Opening and ending broadcast every episode had to be made properly, so I was made to check all of this.

**Incidentally, opening and ending were shot on 35mm film (main story used 16mm film).** This was because many prints had to be made, and staff and lyrics text had to be optically composited. So even using the same materials (cels, backgrounds), opening and ending had finer grain than main story images.

**"Red, right, ground shadow. X-28, right."** These are **Morishita-san**'s words. About ground shadows under the Saints running toward us in the opening's first cut. This was Morishita-san's first words at the opening color direction meeting. When paints were used for coloring, we'd communicate colors and color nuances using paint numbers as common vocabulary like this. So, "X-28, right." Incidentally, blood-like vivid red.

**The **Seiya** **Cloth** equipping cut shared with main story used main story cut animation, but **Araki-san** personally changed timesheet frame timing, removed some animation cels, and used it for opening with strong/weak tempo.**

**Opening and ending work came after Episode 1 work was finished, and we were pressed for time.** Cels painted at the last minute had color mistakes, and I have memories of repainting large cels alone at the large-format light table for late-night coloring (laughs).

**Color mismatches appeared in rushes completed at the last minute, but there was no time to fix them, so they became "lifelong embarrassing retake #1" (bitter laugh).** In an ending cut where large cel hair flowing was on repeat, cel misalignment couldn't be fixed until the end, becoming "lifelong embarrassing retake #2" (bitter laugh).

**Near the end of the opening, the **Athena** statue rising from below cut.** The Athena statue's shadow colors were painted differently in the cut's first and second halves, and I secretly OK'd it as-is - that's a secret (laughs).

**Oh, I think Episode 1 also had quite a few **dousa** (in-between animation photography) cuts?** "**Dousa** came out (sweat)," we were all panicking. **Gensan** (original photography) and layout photography being commonplace now makes it somewhat cute (laughs).

**Anyway, *Saint Seiya* Episode 1 was completed this way.**

**When the first screening ended and he stood up, Chief Director **Morishita-san** said one thing: "That's it. This will be cancelled after 2 cours."**

**That *Saint Seiya* would become a huge hit work.**

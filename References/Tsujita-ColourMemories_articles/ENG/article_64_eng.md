# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 64: Once Upon a Time... (41) - Theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors*

Before I knew it, it's September.

Agh, it's September!

Cicadas are still barely chirping, but on cool nights I can hear autumn insects' voices. Before I knew it, evenings are getting dark earlier. Morning doesn't get bright until after 4:30 either.

Where did this year's August go?

As I get older, summer feels shorter every year. Naturally the length of months, days, and hours is the same now as always, but subjective speed seems to accelerate yearly, and this year's August passed at my personal record speed. Ah, farewell! My 45-year-old summer (sobbing)!

Will next year pass even faster?

So many things I want to do, places I want to go...

Next year I'm wanting to take the entire month of August as summer vacation. Would that be impossible?

Such is this melancholy September (crying).

Well then.

March 1992 release, theatrical *Dragon Ball Z: Clash! The 10 Billion Power Warriors*. Director Nishio Daisuke, animation director Maeda Minoru, art director Taniguchi Jun'ichi.

While the TV series follows Toriyama Akira's original in animation form, theatrical works are basically side stories. This *10 Billion Power Warriors* was one such film. An enemy called Metal Cooler arrives and fights intensely with Goku. Oh well, that's roughly it.

I've forgotten various content details by now (bitter laugh). I don't have any completed video or anything myself. The storyboard I used back then might still be archived somewhere...

That storyboard. Director Nishio was struggling with the climactic final battle area, and that section's storyboard remained cut off abruptly. However, we naturally couldn't wait for its completion before starting work, so we proceeded with various tasks excluding that climax portion.

That storyboard was completed around early February. Since this work's editing was around the second weekend of February, it was about one week before. Then animator Ide-san apparently drew from layout to rough key animation for that section in one week, somehow getting through editing and dubbing.

Oh yes, March releases around that time were "spring vacation timing" around the 20th, so editing was in February. Now they've moved up to early March release, so editing and dubbing finish by late January accordingly.

Now, about colors.

Theatrical versions of TV works operate on the principle that "people watching TV will come see them," so if they become different from TV, that's problematic. Aside from animation, different-looking colors are bad. Things that were red on TV must be red in theatrical versions, blue things must be blue. That was the rule about not changing those.

However, theatrical versions naturally have different volume from TV versions. When TV version colors are just plopped into theatrical version screens, they inevitably feel light and float. So I started from designing main character color tones specifically for theatrical versions.

That said, unlike now with digital coloring where you can do subtle things infinitely, it was fine adjustments within cel paint color limitations. So normal colors stayed mostly the same as TV color direction, with balance reviews centered on shadow color depth. I reset shadow colors somewhat deeper than TV. And there was another big reason for this.

It was the Taiyo Shikisai paint problem again.

As I've written before, while most industry production company works used Taiyo Shikisai cel paints, almost only Toei Doga used STAC cel paints. With sufficient production schedule, naturally everything could be outsourced to Manila studios or domestic finishing productions handling Toei Doga work, having everything colored with STAC paints. But with such tight schedules, that wasn't possible. A considerable portion had to be requested from Korean productions, meaning naturally the paints would be Taiyo Shikisai cel paints.

Basic color direction is designed with STAC colors, then "converted" to Taiyo Shikisai colors. However, naturally STAC and Taiyo don't have identical colors. STAC color direction gets applied to "almost the same" color paints for "conversion." "Almost the same" can be "slightly different," and combinations of those "slightly different" colors can sometimes become "quite different."

Common with normal colors and their shadow colors is when the normal color conversion is slightly darker than original STAC color, and shadow color conversion is slightly brighter than original STAC color - the finished cel's normal and shadow often end up with almost no difference.

So by designing shadow colors slightly deeper in the original STAC color design to create difference, even when converted to Taiyo colors, there shouldn't be major impression differences from the original - that's what I thought.

So in early 1992, I frantically prepared "conversions." And finally color direction with Taiyo Shikisai paint conversion began.

## Episode 86: Excuse Me Extra Edition - *Casshern Sins* Flashback and New Programs

In Tokyo, the cherry blossoms have passed their peak, and petals are fluttering in the refreshing wind like a blizzard. How is everyone doing?

Recently, a grand wrap party for *Casshern Sins* was held, and I was able to reunite with familiar faces. Naturally, it continued to a second party, third party, and we got excited and talked until morning. Particularly with the director, we talked deeply about the "behind-the-scenes stories" of the final episode's Casshern and Luna scenes that didn't make it into the footage.

(I wonder if that topic came up in the recent Anime Style interview? I wasn't there so I don't know)

Then, quite the "backlash" hit me, both physically and mentally - wham! (laughs). My condition dropped all at once, and I couldn't get my hands on this column manuscript or even other work... So I'm writing this apology and excuse (tears).

I'll try to recover starting from next week's installment.

Now then.

April means new program season. This season, I'm participating in two programs.

The first is *Marie & Gali* (マリー＆ガリー).

It broadcasts within the program "Sue Ensa" on NHK Educational every Tuesday at 7:25 PM. Each episode is 5 minutes long, but recklessly it's a continuous story (laughs). I handled the color design (色彩設計) for the main characters.

For *Marie & Gali*, apparently due to NHK policy, they can't put all the individual episode staff credits on air. Moreover, the credits for "Sue Ensa" overall are also included. So those concerned about staff should pay attention.

Oh, there's also a rerun Saturday mornings.

The other one is *Ultimate!! Mecha-Mote Chairman* (極上!!めちゃモテ委員長). It's currently broadcasting on TV Tokyo network every Saturday at 9 AM. For this one, I'm handling overall color design.

*Mecha-Mote Chairman* isn't regular drawn animation - it's produced roughly 80% with 3D CG.

Storyboards are drawn normally for 2D, and backgrounds are also drawn normally (though sometimes made in 3D). The part that animation staff would handle - layout → key animation → in-between animation - is made entirely with 3D CG. They have 3D models perform, output that data, and composite it with backgrounds for photography. Since the characters themselves are made with CG, basically the work equivalent to coloring disappears too.

However, there are cuts that are quite difficult to do in 3D CG, and those follow the conventional animation → coloring process. So it's completed as a mixture of 2D and 3D (therefore, color direction in the credits refers to color direction for 2D parts).

My work involves adding colors to hand-drawn character settings from the character designer and deciding on them. Props are basically the same. These are then converted to 3D and made into screens. Naturally there are things where 3D models are created first, and I check the colors on those too, creating unified color tone. For night and evening scene colors, since 2D and 3D are often mixed, I give instructions and have photography processing bring them together well.

For me it's quite a new way of working, so surrounded by fashionable magazine piles, I'm enjoying participating with interest, but I'm running quite behind on my work and causing lots of trouble (heavy sweat).

Such was my spring situation.

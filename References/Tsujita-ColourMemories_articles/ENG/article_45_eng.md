# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 45: Sorry! Currently in Rehabilitation...

The other day, I changed my mobile phone model. It's the 705i series! Finally—or rather, at last—I'm now a FOMA person (← so late).

"Mobile phones basically just need to be able to make calls!" has been my philosophy. So I stayed with mova for a long time, mostly OK with just phone functions, but it turns out that switching to FOMA would be much more economical no matter how much email I send or how much I connect to the internet! Plus it works overseas too, so I went with FOMA. Apparently, in my case, it'll be about half of what I was paying before (stunned).

The problem is the phone design. I hate big ones, and no matter how thin they are, flip phones don't suit me. Something small, solid but thin, and not flip-style. There was one that perfectly met those requirements. Its release kept getting delayed, but it went on sale last week, so I went straight to the docomo shop.

That model is from a certain European company. Orange-colored and so cool... But well, as expected, the usability is quite different from Japanese manufacturers. It's like somehow it doesn't quite scratch where it itches (bitter laugh). But including that, it's quite a cute device! (laugh) I'm quite satisfied.

Now, carrying this phone, I'll finally fulfill my ambition of overseas expansion! (mysterious)

Well then.

*Hakaba Kitaro* finished all its broadcasts last week (in the Kanto region), and I'm currently in rehabilitation in various senses (laugh).

You know, after doing something that intense for the first time in a while, I need to switch mental gears, and when I work on colors for other productions, I can't shake the sense of that *Hakaba Kitaro* filter, which is troubling. Hence, rehabilitation (laugh).

At times like this, it's good to go out into the world around you—or rather, into the town where you live, your neighborhood—or to listen carefully and let your thoughts wander to those scenes.

Actually, since the beginning of this month, when I listen carefully in the morning, I can hear beautiful bird songs from a certain park adjacent to our house. Something like "kekyo kyukyu kyokyo"—at first it was a very clumsy song, but as it's gotten warmer recently, it's become much better at singing properly, like "ho-hokekyo kyokyokyo." Yes, the voice belongs to a warbler (uguisu).

My home is in Tokyo's Nakano. While it's adjacent to Shinjuku and is part of the "big city," it's basically a residential area with quite a bit of greenery—not as much as Suginami or Nerima, but enough that you can hear voices of wild birds like this. Well, of course, the ones with the most influence are still the crows, but I feel like there are fewer crows than there used to be...

That warbler—while plum blossom season is almost over, I expect it will continue to entertain us with its voice for quite a while yet. Ah, this sounds like a "tea on the veranda" kind of story (bitter laugh).

Oh yes, the cherry blossoms have started blooming all at once. For the next two weeks or so, Tokyo will be flooded with cherry blossom pink wherever you go (laugh).

Speaking of "cherry blossoms" in recent work I've done, there's the theatrical *CLANNAD*. Cherry blossom petals dancing through layers upon layers of full-bloom cherry tree avenues. When doing color direction for things like conveying depth and atmosphere to people watching the screen, your own experiences—the sensations you know from actually seeing real scenery—really come in handy.

We tend to stay glued to our desks at work, but going outside to see various things and experience that atmosphere is really necessary. These days, you can find most reference materials on the internet, but you can't sense things like light, wind, and smells from just photos and such.

That's exactly why I think: seize the moment and play lots! Go lots of places, see lots of things, experience lots of things, and be impressed by lots of "wow"s. Starting from your neighborhood, then going on outings and trips. The more you play, the better work you can do—I believe that and play accordingly (laugh).

So, being "in rehabilitation," I'll keep it short this week (explosion).

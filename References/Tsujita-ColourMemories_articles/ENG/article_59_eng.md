# Color Design Notes [Tsujita Kunio]

## Episode 59: Summer Vacation Special - Saint Seiya: Hades Inferno Chapter & Elysion Chapter Completion & Broadcast Memorial Complete Episode Notes (Part 1)

Sorry, I took another two-week break, but I'm back starting this week.

Japan's summer high school baseball tournament at Koshien has begun. I listen to the daily heated battles throughout my work time. The "crack!" of the ball from the radio and the loud cheering from the stands beyond are my work companions during this season.

The brass band cheering from those stands still gets excited over *Space Battleship Yamato* (宇宙戦艦ヤマト) and *Triton of the Sea* (海のトリトン) this year too. They're Koshien cheering brass standards now. Man, these two songs are anime theme songs from when I was in elementary school, so it's been about 35-36 years now. That's quite something.

And listening carefully, each school has slightly different arrangements. There must be brass sheet music collections available. Maybe veteran schools have traditional arrangement sheets unique to their schools, passed down continuously. Thinking about such things, I'm enjoying this brief "summer."

When Koshien begins, summer really feels like it's heading toward the halfway point.

Well then.

Last month, *Saint Seiya: Hades Elysion Chapter* (聖闘士星矢 冥王ハーデス エリシオン編) was completed. The first *Saint Seiya* TV broadcast was in 1986. While there was a long gap in between, it took a total of 22 years to complete all of Kurumada-sensei's original "Saint Seiya."

The final episodes 5 and 6 of *Elysion Chapter* are currently airing with great acclaim on SKY PerfecTV! To commemorate this on my own, here's a three-part "Saint Seiya: Hades Inferno Chapter & Elysion Chapter Completion & Broadcast Memorial Complete Episode Notes."

Oh, sorry to non-Saint Seiya fans (sweat).

Now then.

First, *Inferno Chapter: Prelude*. At the end of episode 13 of director Yamauchi Shigeyasu's *Hades Twelve Temples Chapter* series, Seiya heads to the underworld. The story begins where Shun and the others follow Seiya to the underworld.

From *Inferno Chapter*, the director changed to Katsumata Tomoharu. Katsumata-san directed from episode 2 of the first series too. Other main staff remained roughly the same, but naturally the taste changes when directors change. So what kind of feel would it change to?

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 1 - Cross! River Acheron - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

As with any series, I try to handle color direction for episode 1 myself whenever possible. Only by actually touching the main story and key animation do detailed points requiring attention become visible. I handled color direction for this episode 1 too.

This series has almost the entire story set in the "underworld." So naturally it's a dark atmosphere. However, if we made the character colors themselves too dark, the entire production risked becoming gloomy, so that balance was one key point.

In the previous *Hades Twelve Temples Chapter*, the stage setting was "perpetual night in Sanctuary on Earth," so we realistically created "nighttime darkness" character colors. But this time the stage is the "underworld."

"Once we enter the 'underworld,' that becomes the baseline, so wouldn't brighter be better?" said director Katsumata. So I designed the underworld basics on the bright side. While suppressing brightness slightly from so-called "normal" coloring, since backgrounds themselves are dark, they don't actually look that dark on screen - designed to look almost "normal."

So episode 1. It's just the story of endlessly traveling the River Acheron by boat. Hmm, quite plain (bitter laugh).

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 2 - Silent Courtroom - Direction/Sasaki Noriyo**

From episode 2 where the story gets moving, I passed the color direction baton to Kobioki-san. Kobioki-san handled color direction for all episodes through episode 6.

The color scheme system for Specters was already established in the previous series, so based on that, we referenced the original artwork coloring (for example, whether hair was solid black or white outline in the original) to create colors. So episode 2's guest character Lune became silver-haired.

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 3 - Legendary Saint Orpheus - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

The opening scene with Pharaoh & Cerberus is designed slightly darker than the underworld's basic colors. Since Seiya's Pegasus Cloth base is white, he really stands out floating in dark spaces (bitter laugh).

So when deciding basic color tones for each scene, Pegasus Cloth always becomes the standard. How much to suppress the white became the key point.

Oh yes, Lyra Orpheus appearing in episode 3 was also almost white-based.

In *Saint Seiya*, there are several "technique" scenes during battles, and as a series principle, character colors became special coloring in those "technique spaces." Through about episode 3, both the technique user and target got special coloring, but from the latter half we organized it a bit: technique users emit auras while keeping character colors normal-ish for some contrast, while only targets get that space's special coloring.

Incidentally, when getting "WHAM!" blown away, we made it a rule to give the victim high-contrast processing, organizing this too.

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 4 - Orpheus: Sad Requiem - Direction/Shinda Yu**

In the consistently dark-backgrounded underworld, the place where Eurydice is captured in episodes 3-4 is a bright flower garden. So characters are also set brightly.

However, in bright spaces, the effects when Seiya and others fight don't stand out on screen well. This is quite difficult. So when battles begin, we'd make it an image space or somehow ensure light effects would show up. This homework carried over directly to Elysion Chapter.

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 5 - Hades! Shocking Possession - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

Hades' chamber. The basic character color balance here is actually my personal favorite. Suppressing brightness while still showing proper color tones. It feels good (laugh).

The transitions between the bright throne area and dark audience chamber worked well too.

And Hades with "Shun's face." On the production floor he was called "Hades-Shun" (laugh). When he's Andromeda Shun, he has slightly pink-tinted, relatively healthy skin color, but after Hades' possession, we made it a bloodless color tone.

**Inferno Chapter: Prelude Episode 6 - Fierce Battle! Road to Judecca - Direction/Katsumata Tomoharu**

When one Gold Saint enters the screen, it tightens up perfectly. And when facing the purplish-gray Rhadamanthys and other three Inferno Judges, they stand out even more (laugh).

And finally the ace appears - Ikki! (laugh) While all five Bronze Saints' auras are photography processing, Phoenix Ikki's orange aura stands out most beautifully on screen among the five. Somehow he looks strongest and best (laugh).

***

The full 6 episodes that we should have approached with plenty of leeway - the final two were still somewhat, or rather considerably, tight scheduling. Even so, *Inferno Chapter* got started somehow. After finishing *Prelude*, there was much to consider, and I began preparing homework for what came next.
